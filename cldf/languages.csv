aari1239-1,"Aari, Ethiopia",aari1239,Aari,aiw,Africa,5.95034,36.5721,South Omotic,Aari.htm,"Ms. Carolyn Ford, SIM International, Ethiopia, November 25, 1995, May 25, 2007",,"Aari has a numeral system based on twenty. The first word for twenty means ' size' or ' stocky ', the second word ' ʔéwólːáqbab ʔits ' means 'person-one to-eat ' and forty can be expressed by ' ʔéqastːénbaːb ʔits ', which means 'person-two to-eat ', but nowadays, they often use Amharic numerals for large numbers. Aari has two tonesː high tone = v́, low tone (unmarked). The Aari numeral system is decimal and there are many complex numerals, which derived from more than base form. The following are basic numerals starting from number one to ten. wollaχ ‘one’ qastən ‘two’ makkən ‘three’ ojidi ‘four’ donq ‘five’ laa ‘six’ təbza ‘seven’ qastən təmmərs ‘eight’ wolχan təmmərs ‘nine’ təmma ‘ten’ The numerals (qastən təmmərs) ‘eight’ and (wolχan təmmərs) ‘nine’ are both respectively formed from (qastən) ‘two’ and (təmmərs).Also, (wolχan) ‘one’ and (təmmərs). In each case, the second word is the same. Thus, (qastən təmmərs) can be interpreted as ‘two more to ten’ and (wolχan təmmərs) ‘one more to ten’ Numerals (11-19) can form with the combination of (təmma) ‘ten’ and lower numerals. Look the following numerals (11-19) təmma wolaχ ‘eleven’ təmma qastən ‘twelve’ təmma makkən ‘thirteen’ təmma ojidi ‘fourteen’ təmma donq ‘fifteen’ təmma laa ‘sixteen’ təmma təbza ‘seventeen’ təmma qastən təmmərs ‘eighteen’ təmma wolχan təmmərs ‘nineteen’ Numeral twenty (20) has a lexical form (boonda) ‘one full person’. The other decimal numbers from thirty to one hundred formed as follow: 3.a. boonda - kə təmmə - k ‘thirty’ a full person – CONJ ten – CONJ ‘one full person and ten’ b. e – qastən- baβ its ‘forty’ person – two-father eat ‘eat two persons owner’ c. e- qastən- baβ its – kə təmmə -k ‘fifty’ Person - two -father eat–CONJ ten- CONJ ‘eat owner of two persons and ten’ d. e – makkən- baβ its ‘sixty’ person – three-father eat ‘eat owner of three persons ’ e. e – makkən- baβ its - kə təmmə -k ‘seventy’ person-three-father eat–CONJ ten - CONJ ‘eat owner of three persons and ten’ f. e – ojidi - baβ its ‘eighty’ person-four-fatherr eat ‘eat owner of four persons’ g. e – ojidi - baβ its – kə təmmə-k ‘ninety’ person-four-father eat-CONJ ten- CONJ ‘eat owner of four persons and ten’ h. e – donq - baβ its ‘one hundred’ person-five-father eat ‘eat owner of five persons ’ As you have seen the above examples numerals start from thirty and the above describing by changing the numbers, which come before person. For instance, one full person represents the numeral ‘twenty’. In Aari numbering system one full person related with the number of fingers, which one person has (both hand and leg fingers). Therefore, numerals starting from thirty and the above expressed by relating with the number of ‘full person eat’ and numerals begin (40) and above use (its) ‘eat’ as in (e-qastən-baβ its) ‘eat father of two persons’ represents numeral 40 (forty), (e-makkən-baβ its) ‘eat father of three persons’ represents numeral 60 (sixty). In all examples, ‘baβ’ stands for the meaning ‘father’. Again, odd numerals such as 30, 50, 70, 90 and the like take conjunction (-kə) which is suffixed on the word (its) ‘eat’ and then add the numeral (təmma) ‘ten’ with the conjunction (-k) but in case of 30 (thirty) we cannot get the word (its) consider the following examples. 4. a. boonda – kə təmmə - k ‘thirty’ full person -CONJ ten –CONJ ‘one full person and ten’ b. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - k ‘fifty’ person-two-father eat – CONJ ten - CONJ ‘eat owner of two persons and ten’ c. e – makkən- baβ its – kə təmmə -k ‘seventy’ person-three-father eat – CONJ ten – CONJ ‘eat owner of three persons and ten’ d. e – ojidi - baβ its – kə təmmə - k ‘ninety’ person-four-father eat - CONJ ten - CONJ ‘eat owner of four persons and ten’ The above odd numerals take lower numerals next to numeral (təmma) ‘ten’ and conjunction (-kə). Look the following examples of numerals from 51-59 (fifty - one up to fifty – nine). 5. a. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə wolaχ ‘fifty one’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten - CONJ one ‘eat two persons and ten plus one’ b. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə qastən ‘fifty two’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten - CONJ two ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus two’ c. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə makkən ‘fifty three’ person-two-father eat -CONJ ten - CONJ three ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus three’ d. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə ojidi ‘fifty four’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten – CONJ four ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus four’ e. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə donq ‘fifty five’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten – CONJ five ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus five’ f. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə laa ‘fifty six’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten - CONJ six ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus six’ g. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə - kə təbza ‘fifty seven’ person- two-father eat-CONJ ten - CONJ seven ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus seven’ h. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə-kə qastən təmmərs ‘fifty eight’ person-two-father eat–CONJ ten – CONJ eight ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus eight’ i. e – qastən - baβ its – kə təmmə-kə wolχan təmmərs ‘fifty nine’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten - CONJ nine ‘eat owner of two persons and ten plus nine’ The following are some numerals above 100 (one hundred) 6.a. e – donq - baβ its – kə təmmə-k ‘one hundred ten’ person-two-father eat-CONJ ten-CONJ ‘eat owner of five persons and ten’ b. e – donq- baβ its – kə boondə - k ‘one hundred twenty’ person-two-father eat-CONJ twenty-CONJ ‘eat owner of five persons and twenty’ c. e – donq - baβ its – kə boondə - kə təmmə-k ‘one hundred thirty’ person-two-father eat-CONJ twenty-CONJ ten-CONG ‘eat owner of five persons and twenty plus ten’ d. e – təbza - baβ its ‘one hundred forty’ person-seven-father eat ‘eat owner of seven persons’ e. e – təbza - baβ its – kə təmmə -k ‘one hundred fifty’ person-seven-father eat-CONJ ten-CONJ ‘eat owner of seven persons and ten’ f. e – qastən təmmərs- baβ its ‘one hundred sixty’ person - eight – father eat ‘eat owner of eight persons’ g. e – qastən təmmers-baβ its – kə təmm-ək ‘one hundred seventy’ person - eight – father eat-CONJ ten-CONJ ‘eat owner of eight persons and ten’ h. e – wolχan təmmərs - baβ its ‘one hundred eighty’ person - nine - father eat ‘eat owner of nine persons’ i. e - wolχan təmmərs - baβ its – kə təmmə -k ‘one hundred ninety’ person - nine - father eat-CONJ ten-CONJ ‘eat owner nine persons and ten’ j. e – təmma- baβ its ‘two hundred’ person-ten-father eat ‘eat owner of ten prsons’ All numerals started from forty- (40) and the above have (e-) at their beginning position. In this context (e-) stands for ‘a person’ but it omits the consonant (-d) from the normal expression. Therefore, in a word level ‘ed’ represents the word ‘person’."

Lean: Counting Systems of Papua New Guinea, volume 13, West Sepik (Sadaun ) Province. Lae, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Papua New Guinea University of Technology. 1991.",,"Abau numerals 1, 2 and 3 depend on the object being counted. When tallying various objects the Abau people use an unusual system which is essential a digit tally one but which also uses the navel, breast, and the eye as tally points for certain numbers. The first three words are in fact numerals which denote numerals only and are not the names of the body parts. There are distinct words for 1 and 2, and 3 has the construction '2+ 1''. Tallying starts on the little finger of the left hand and proceeds in order to the index finger at a tally of 4; this is 'yorpow lopa', i.e, 'thumb not' or the fingers of the hand excluding the thumb. 5 is 'yorbou non', i.e, 'thumb with or the finger of the hand including the thumb. The tally words for 6, 7, and 8 are: 6: 'iha sirom pruw non': 'hand one navel with', 7. 'iha sirom mu nareysar non': 'hand one breast two', 8. 'iha sirom mu nareysar pruw non': hand one breast two navel with'. In tallying 9 and 10 the right hand is used rather than non-digit body parts: 9: 'iha sirom iha ihaaw': 'hand one hand finger only', i.e, one hand and the fingers of one hand excluding the thumb. 10. 'iha seys': 'hand(s) two'. The tally words for 11, 12, 13 and 14 are: 11. ' iha seys pruw non': 'hand(s) two navel with', 12. 'iha seys mu nareysar': 'hand(s) two breast two', 13. 'iha seys mu nareysar pruw non': 'hand(s) two breast two navel with', 14. 'iha seys mu nareysar pruw nehe namon': 'hand(s) two breast two navel', for 15, however, we have: 'iha seys sune sirom': 'hand(s) two foot one'. Tallying 20 following the pattern we usually have for a digit-tally system: 'iha seys sune seys': 'hand(s) two feet two'. In tallying 40 this pattern is continued: 'iha seys sune seys ur prein-so iha seys sune seys', i.e. 'hand(s) two feet two man, one's hand(s) two feet two' or hand two breast two. The system thus possesses a 20-cycle ( or 'man' cycle) which may be seen explicitly in the tally word for 100: 'ur iha sirom': 'man hand one' or 'man five' or hands two foot two."

December 19, 2016.",,"Abuan has an old counting system which was unable to handle large numbers- 400 being the highest. The number one always behaves like a descriptive adjective; the numerals 2-9 are indeclinable. Any of these might be added to the numbers 20, 30, 40 and 60, with e.g. 79 becoming 60 +10 + 9. 80 and numbers up to 400 and beyond all involved both multiplication and addition always using 20 or 400 as the basic e. g. 119 was 5 times 20 + 10+ 9; 519 was 400 + 5 times 20 plus ten plus 9. The system is now in the process of being changed to multiples of 10, 100, 1000 which of course suits the modern world much better. The notation will need to be reinterpreted first into the Abuan orthography, then into IPA. The symbol [ before b, d, a, e, i, o, u means that each of these letters has a subscript dot in the orthography; this subscript dot is an implosive marker in the case of the consonants and a concord marker in the case of the vowels. A dotted vowel in the orthography indicates that all preceding vowels in the word are also dotted (lax vowels). Absence of subscript dot under a vowel means that that vowel is a tense vowel.

Even so, this is clearly a quinary system. A few other compound number forms were recorded by C. Hart Merriam, but I was not able to verify them; they are constructed in ways analogous to the above. There are a few things to note in particular. Stop aspiration is contrastive only syllable-initially. The plain stops are voiceless-released syllable-finally, and voiced (to the extent that English ‘voiced’ stops are) word-initially and after short vowel. After vocalic length, plain stops are preaspirated (e.g. in a·tú·m͗i) and laryngealized stops are ‘preglottalized’, so that vowel quality is in those positions more salient than duration (short vowels being more centralized than their long counterparts)."

Adzera people might have an old counting system combines a counting system based on two with tallying on hand and feet up to 20. However, now Adzera really has only two basic numbers: one and two. Everything else is either a combination of those two numbers or some anatomical extension like one hand, two hands, etc. But Adzera never, to my knowledge, had a full counting system as some PNG languages do where they count different points on the body. I don't know what other Austronesian counting systems are like. Having only two and one and then having to use a hand for five makes for a very inefficient counting system, and traditionally they probably didn't have to do a lot of precision counting and math in their culture. So what has happened is Tok Pisin and English counting systems have largely replaced the Adzera counting system. When talking about only a few items, they will often use the Adzera numerals, but they sometimes use the Tok Pisin and English numbers even for small numbers and, in my experience, they always use Tok Pisin or English numerals for larger numbers (probably anything larger than five). Because those and many of the numbers Holzknecht gave would most likely be substituted with English and Tok Pisin numbers. You would be much more likely to hear 'five' or 'faivpela' or see '5' or '5-pela' written than to hear or see 'iruʔ da iruʔ da bitsʔ (two and two and one) or 'baŋin bitsintaʔ' (one hand) or 'baŋi marafain' (hand one-side). Sue uses a <c> to represent the alveo-palatal affricate, which is represented by <ts> in Adzera and usually <ch> in English. This is often pronounced closer to [ts] in English. For 'one' I often hear [bisinta'], rather than [bitsinta'], but generally continue to spell it with a <ts> rather than just <s>. This may be dialect variation. The short form is [bits], with the <ts> consistently more alveolar than alveo-palatal, i.e. more like <ts> in English than <ch>. The short form often has the connotation of 'one more'. Sue uses a superscript <n> to represent prenasalisation in the phonetic transcription, which appears simply as an <n> in the Adzera orthography. I have changed <ng> to eng in some places and corrected a couple glosses. Glottal stops are represented with apostrophes in the Adzera orthography. I have not seen the form [iruʔun] or <iru'un>. The form I am familiar with is [iruʔrun] or <iru'run>. I have even seen a longer form, [iruʔruŋun] or <iru'ruŋun>. I'm not sure if Sue's transcription is a mistake or a dialectual variant. As Sue transcribed, the short form for 'two' is [iruʔ] or <iru'>, and it can mean not only 'two', but also 'a few'. The long form always refers specifically to 'two'."

Partial Conclusion: Although it is a relatively simple numerical system, the combinations’ possibilities that result in variations make a complex system, for instance: when the suffixes appear -nan ~ -an (plural affirmative, links answer plus evidential situation); beside this -ne is a suffix that appointed to plural assertive also. When you have the plural forms both of them can be realized on the same structure, for example: Asakërëknan pona asakërëkne ipona = 12 Asakërëknan pona asakërëkne osoruwau ipona = 15 The complexity of this system also forms by the name in the possessed form miyak hand (inya=her-his hand); also by postposition in possessed form (i-pona). But include also word are on subjacent structure like (pona), (miyak) in Tiwin miyak (pona) asakërëkne (miyak) putu and (putu) in Asakrëkne pona asakrë (not appears) those example depend of conversations. Let´s think about the possibilities for this Numeral system: 1) Binaries’ system or system's base 2: that base 2 effects derive from general constraints of symmetry. I am meaning (two fingers, two hands side by side and two feet side by side, one man side by side). If I considered that number 3 has a little morphology from number 2 I have a system's base 2. Although I have not yet motivation substantiated to number 3. 2) The Numeral system in Inkarîkok is incomplete and needs more research. Boa Vista- Roraima, 31 July 2017."

Here is a basic description of the number system: rba (one), sirs (hand), wras (leg), yuht yimar (one whole man = 20) Phonetic guide: H (voiced velar fricative/ voiceless when word initial or word final) F (voiced bilabial fricative/ voiceless when word initial or word final) Schwa occurs between any and all consonants which naturally require a pause. We do not write the schwa in our language. So, using the word “hutf,” it would really be (voiceless velar fricative followed by the “oo” (as in shoot) followed by the t followed by a schwa followed by a voiceless bilabial fricative) The numbers from 20 and beyond are all in Pidgin English because that is how they say those numbers."

No more indigenous forms for numerals above 20; Harakmbut speakers who want to express cardinally quantified NPs (above 20) use Spanish numerals (loans). Alternatively, they use indigenous wakkanda ‘many’ to indicate large quantities (above 20). When asked to count in Harakmbut, most speakers do not get further than 5, and very often not further than 3. This means that the complex forms (as of 6) are very infrequently used.

This stands to reason as Dilling is the local hub town for the Ama. The Dilling language is now dying (Mugaddam 2007) and Arabic is used in the town instead, so the incorporation of Dilling numbers into Ama (if it was that way round) must date back to a time before the shift to Arabic. Ama has three tone marksː high (á) mid (ā) low (à) Dr. Angelika Jakobi’s commentary on Ama numeralsː Russel Norton suggests that the Ama numerals 6, 7, 8, 9 are borrowed from the Dilling language (genetically belonging to Kordofan Nubian). As the Ama area is not only geographically close to Dilling but also to other Kordofan Nubian languages like Karko, Wali and Ghulfan Morung I doubt that it is possible to identify the Kordofan Nubian language from which Ama borrowed those numerals. Apart from 6, 7, 8, 9, there is evidence that tárfó 20 is also a borrowing from a Kordofan Nubian language. The direction of borrowing from Kordofan Nubian to Nyimang (rather than vice versa) is suggested by the fact that cognates of the numerals 6, 7, 8, 9 (but not 20) are attested in other Nubian languages, too, which are spoken in the Nile valley and Darfur (i.e. outside of the Kordofan Nubian and Ama area).

Please note that the following are the base morphemes. They cannot occur in isolation. They must occur with a complement, not two, but two something. If there is no noun and one is counting in a more abstract sense, one adds a sort of dummy inanimate pronoun. So if teaching a child or a foreigner to count on his fingers etc., the following would have added to them an enclitic, the third person inanimate pronoun, which in this variety would be /=e ˥/ following a consonant and /=j ˥/ following a vowel. Note also that in this language the phonemic glottal stop functions as a tone. Phonetically it has a high rising pattern in most instances, though this varies while the glottalization is more consistent and makes the contrast with the other four tones of the language. This is why there are no tone letters transcribed below for glottallized morphemes. There is some doubt about tone, including glottalization on unstressed syllables, and about the lexical integrity of some of the compositional forms. This requires more fieldwork or at least access to some recordings that I currently don’t have access to. In the compositional forms in 11-12, 14, and 16-19, I suspect that the glottalization in the first syllable is actually not there, or at least not there all the time, but I currently can’t say for certain. Likewise, I am not sure whether to consider forms like /t̪op ˩˥ ɣaɭ ˥˨ n̪t̪iɁ βɣaɁj/ ‘55’, as single words, or if multiple words then I’m not sure how many. This has repercussions because if there is only one stressed syllable per word and if tone only contrasts on stressed syllables, then certain of these tones/glottal stops might not be real. In the past I have elicited all the numbers here and more, but unfortunately it’s been a long time and I don’t trust my memory with data so I am not filling in all the boxes. The problem is, most of my field-notes and recordings are in the United States and I am here in Mexico. When I was last in the US I sent notes and recordings to the AILLA archive, but they haven’t digitized them yet so the information is temporarily unavailable. The forms here for 22 and 23 are surprising to me and not what I would have guessed based on memory, but I was able to find them in a text and so I expect that they are correct. If you’re still working on this topic in a few months feel free to check back with me to see if the notes are digitized yet, or look for them on the AILLA website. Consider the form 55 which I cited above, I believe it should say '15'. It seems that a morpheme –n̪- unites powers of ten/twenty but when ones are added to these units –β- is used. The unique forms for ‘13’ and ‘55’ are not repeated in greater numbers, where instead the compounds revert to 10+ 3 and 10+ 5 strings. In 22 and 23, or at least the forms gleaned from this text I mentioned, it is surprising here that the ti string shows up, as if meaning ‘10’, but note that the -n̪- is absent. Compare ‘22’ to ‘30’. The form for ‘22’ is surprising and the ti makes it look like it would be 32 instead of 22, but you can see that ’30 has an –n- which is lacking in the form given in the text for ‘22’. The forms for ‘70’ and ‘90’, which I did not fill in below because I could not find them in the notes I have with me, I did find in the notes of a previous researcher (Dow Robinson, who published his notes in 1961 I believe), though I do not completely trust his notes, but since mine are unavailable, it’s worth mentioning that I interpret his transcription of ’70’ as /t͡ᶊon̪ ˩˥ ɣaɭ ˥˨ nʐo ˩ t̪iɁ/ and his transcription of ‘90’ as /ðap ˥˨ ɣaɭ ˥˨ nʐo ˩ t̪iɁ/. /n-ʐo˩/ is HABITUAL-there.are, so perhaps the latter string would be literally ‘four twenties there are ten’ and furthermore perhaps the –n- seen in ‘30’ and ‘50’ below comes from a shortening of /nʐo˩/. Obviously, mil is a Spanish loanword. Note that for numbers 5, 8, 9, 10 and 15: In this language the contrast between plain and laryngealized vowels has merged with the tonal contrast, so that the glottal stop here essentially counts as the tone."

Notice that in Amis, the glottal stop before and after vowels are optionally transcribed, and vowels /u/ and /o/ are used as free variations and the the symbol [ʡ] is an epiglottal plosive. (1) According to Tsuchida (1988), there are five major dialects in Amis: Sakizaya (or Sakiraya), Northern (or Nanshi Amis), Tavalong-Vataan, Central, (Haian Amis and Hsiukulan Amis excluding Tavalong-Vataan) and Southern (Peinan Amis and Hengchun Amis). Sakizaya has been politically recognized as an independent language by the government of Taiwan, and hence, its data will not be listed in the table. Notice that Tsuchida’s classification is slightly different from the dialects officially recognized by the Taiwanese government, which are Northern, Central (including Tavalong-Vataan Amis and Hsiukulan Amis in Tsuchida’ classification), Haian, Malan (or Falangaw, roughly corresponding to Peinan Amis in Tsuchida’s classification), and Hengchun. The examples from Vataan are collected from Hui- Mei Lin, a native speaker of this dialect. The rest of the examples are cited from the 1000-word Vocabulary List published by the Council of Indigenous Peoples: 1229CD7C. However, I have made some corrections after double checking with the native speakers. The List published on-line still needs further proof-reading and revision.

The speaker of Vataan only provides me muɁtəp here. I am not sure if it can be used in serial counting in this dialect. (3) Sabaw or safaw roughly means the “the decimal digit”. tu is the oblique case (4) ''a'' in 20 and other tens is a a linker. It shows up between a modifier and a noun. (5) “maləbut” or “ləfot” originally means “angry”. It is used metaphorically here as when one has to count up to 1000, one might get impatient and angry."

In this regard word for numbers 11, 12…21… and the like end with low tone. Anfillo is claimed to have two tones such as high and low tone. Normally words with long vowel bear high tone while words with short vowel bear low tone."

However, the numbers 9-24 are made up of four similar cycles. In some cases there are alternative terms, which are separated by a slash mark (/ ). When this number is reached, it is said to be ''put aside'' as hor mend, and the counting through 24 takes place again, reaching hor kap. This can continue on through 24 hor: hor tutowapu, or hor hor. Some people consider this to be the largest number, and they do not continue counting beyond it. The expression hor hor with both hands raised and an appropriate facial expression can also imply ''innumerable quantities '' of something. People frequently count the 24 units on their fingers, starting with the thumb of little finger of one hand ( the left hand in most of the examples I saw), then moving to the thumb of the other hand. For numbers 11-20, one can use the fingers again, or else the toes, moving back to four fingers of the left hand for the final four. In some cases, the four finger were down after the previous count, and the final four counts consisted of opening them again. After 10 and 20, the two hands, with closed fingers, are brought together."

When asked for what purpose counting was used in the old days, the old women who know the number names say that counting was used for turtle eggs. However, the number system in Anindilyakwa is more developed that in most other Aboriginal languages. Dr. Peter Worsley, an anthropologist who was on Groote Eylandt, suggested that contact with the Macassans accounted for the development of number names beyond five, as it is normal in Aboriginal languages to count either to three or to five. Since the introduction of English, English words have been used almost exclusively for numbers above five, while both the Anindilyakwa and English words have been used for the numbers up to five and also ten. Today few young people know of the existence of the old Anindilyakwa words for fifteen and twenty, it is probably some times since these words were in use, but they are still remembered by middle-aged and old people.

For number 3 and 4, they actually literally means ""bad brother"" and ""good brother""! It has to do with their conceptualization of a pair being good and unpaired person being not good because he is lonely. This corresponds with how they count using their fingers! They pair up the fingers as they count: so the small finger pairs with the ring finger as they count 1 and 2, and the middle finger pairs with the index finger. So, the middle finger wouldn't be paired until the index finger is counted, which corresponds to the literal meanings of number 3 and 4 (bad brother and good brother). Of course, the use of number has been lexicalized so the native speakers were not able to tell us the original derivation of the number 3 and 4. It was after the lexical comparison and learning the local cultural value!"

arao1248-1,"Araona, Bolivia",arao1248,Araona,aro,South America,-12.4242,-67.7293,Pano-Tacanan,Araona.htm,"Dr. Carola Emkow, Free University of Berlin, Germany, September 9, 2008.",,"The Araona have three different numeral systems: 1. A binary-quinary system, which only has number 'one' peaːda (the root pea means 'one' or 'other' and and number 'two' beta or few. 2. A quinary system listed on the above table. The counting system involves a quinary system from 'five' onwards. According to Heine (1997: 19), quinary systems have two base numbers, the cardinal numbers 'five' and 'twenty'. This implies that both hand(s) and feet are used in counting. The base numbers are most likely to be noun phrases. In the binary-quinary system of Araona, only 'twenty' is a noun phrase. The numeral 'five' is a clause translating as 'it is only one hand'. Acoording to Heine (1997) numerals between 'six' and 'nine', 'eleven' and 'fourteen', and 'sixteen' and 'nineteen' typically have clausal morphosyntax. Araona accords with Heine's predictions. The numerals from six to nine translate into 'this side (which is now used for counting) it is only one/two/three/four'. Numerals from eleven to fourteen are both phrasal and clausal literally translating into 'both hand (plus) its is only one/two/three/four'. Numerals from sixteen to nineteen translate into 'the foot on this side (now used for counting) it is only one/two/three/four'. The numeral ten is a clause literally meaning 'only both hands are finished' (that is the feet have not been used yet). This system is in line with Heine's prediction that the most common operation used in building numerals is addition, frequently expressed by means of the comitative ('with'). The system is in a way 'neater' that the binary-quinary one in that it spells out an arithmetic operation explicitly by using the comitative. All the numerals are noun phrases. In this system the hand is the only body part used for counting. Counting up to twenty is done by means of four hands, and no longer two hands and two feet. In contrast to the previous system, the word for 'four' is not detsekata but mipakata whose etymology is not opaque (see Table 11-3). In the quinary system the actual procedure of counting is accounted for. People only use their fingers (and not their toes) when demonstrating counting. The numeral 'five' refers to the thumb and not to the hand. To understand this, one needs to know how the Araona count. They start counting with the little finger (for 'one'), then the ring finger, the middle finger, the index finger, and finally the thumb for 'five'. Thus, the thumb equals the numeral 'five' and finishes off one quinary block. The meaning 'only' in ~kata 'Intens' meaning 'very/'only' results from the way in which counting procedes. Numerals from six to nine are expressed as 'thumb (hand) with one/two/three/four (fingers)'. The numeral 'ten' translates into 'both hands' and the numerals from 'eleven' to 'fourteen' into 'both hands with one/two/three/four'. The numeral 'fifteen' means 'three hands'. In the numerals from sixteen to 'nineteen' translate into 'three hands (only) with one/two/three/four'. 3.

When I was teaching the illiterate Awa to count, I began teaching the first four numerals in Awa Pit (People's lip or their language). I added numerals 5-10 using Spanish and used the base system of 10 as they would eventually learn in Spanish. They then learned to count to the hundreds and thousands, because they needed to learn to count their own money – a desperate need as they did not have a numerical system in Awa Pit and for those who did not want their ´change’ to be less than was due them. Those who have gone to a traditional school taught in Spanish in the tribal setting, they would learn the Spanish numerical system. For the Unkal Awa of Colombia and Ecuador, their name means 'mountain people' - Unkal means 'mountain' and Awa means 'people'. That has been their traditional name but was changed to Coiquer, Kwaiker, Awa-Cuaiquer, and many other forms since 1934 due to the Hispanic influence when there seems to have been the first recorded contact with the Awa. Their seemingly main allocation was on the plateau called 'kwasker/quasquer' which I believe comes from the Awa Pit 'kwas kùh', which means 'high leaf 'or a 'high flat place.'

Individually these words are not attested. Zanon (1932: 264) speaks of a cryptic counting system that avoids the use of Arabic numeral in order to discuss numbers without outsiders understanding them.

It can be assumed that the latter was not originally used in multiplications and that this function is borrowed from English, just like the use of ten as a multiplicand.

Mr. Jason Stuart, New Tribes Mission, Papua New Guinea, Sept. 2, 2011",,"The above data are provided by Wayne Dye (formerly SIL PNG) on 6/29/2010 based on studies made 1964-1985 and 2007-2008. In order to more clearly show the logic pattern, this table includes more numerals than were requested. From this it is evident that the numeral system has bases of five and twenty. Bahinemo speakers count on hands (actually fingers, including thumb) and toes, starting with one finger closed as one. A hand closed (bafu ‘gone’) is five. Then on the other hand one counts with the same four numbers, 1,2,3, and 4. When both hands are “gone” they start counting on “feet” i.e. toes. Twenty is a “man head entire”. Numbers above that include that phrase, then start over on “another man” (ima yemu). Large numbers quickly become unwieldy. Bahinemo speaking people rarely used numbers for quantities larger than about twenty, and seldom for quantities larger than ten. Numbers above forty were confusing to some Bahinemo speakers. Forty (ima tuwese husi) is the same as the shortened form of twenty-two, which in correct Bahinemo is ima tuwese ima yemu husi. Numbers above one hundred could in theory be correctly spoken, but the resulting phrase is so long and convoluted that hearers in the 1970s puzzled over them. By 2007 no one could make any sense of such phrases; all were using Tok Pisin numerals. This was not a problem for them before the 1970s, since there were virtually no uses for such high numbers in traditional life. Some of our friends with several children, for instance, did not know exactly how many children they had, though they knew each by name very well and cared for them deeply. People did not buy and sell goods; they gave them, expecting only an approximately equal return gift later. Bahinemo is tonal, note on tone patterns on accented words. Unaccented syllables are indicated by mid [v̄] tone phonetically when preceding the stressed syllable or high tone mark [v́]. These syllables preceding the high tone are nearly as high as the stressed syllable and sound nearly the same. Normally these are in the first or second syllables of two and three syllable words when the high tone is on the last syllable of the word. In three syllable words where the accented syllable is on the first syllable the unaccented syllable following that accented first syllable is also mid [v̄]. Unaccented syllables that occur at the end of the word and follow the high [v́] or mid tone [v̄] are low [v̀] indicated with a low tone, the lowest tone in the word. Comments by Jason Stuart, New Tribes Mission, Papua New Guinea, Sept. 2, 2011. Regarding the data you have for the Bahinemo language, it all looks quite accurate. My phonetics my vary slightly from the Dyes, but nothing significant. As Wayne wrote, larger numerals are not used in the vernacular. My experience is that number up to 5 are spoken in Bahinemo; for numbers 6 and above, the Tok Pisin numbers are used--6-pela, 7-pela, etc. In theory, they can construct larger numbers in the vernacular, but this has not been the practice for a few decades. The exception to this is in counting money. The Bahinemo people often use different words to describe different amounts of money to keep the amount secret from outsiders. Most of these descriptions are fairly recent innovations (in the last 5-10 years) since the Bahinemo people have started selling gold, sandalwood, and mossoia bark and have had to deal with larger amounts of cash. While these are newer developments in the language and are not part of the traditional counting, they nonetheless represent where the language is at today. If these would help in your research, I can provide examples. If you are just working with counting systems, then the data you have about Bahinemo seems to be complete."

Numerals in Gubëeher always stand after the noun like all other modifiers. Numerals from ‘one’ to ‘four’ and all numbers whose last digit is ‘1’, ‘2’, ‘3’ or ‘4’, agree with the class of the noun they modify. The counting system of Baïnounk Gubëeher is quinary, its base of 5 adopting a body part model up to 20. From 20 to 99 it is vigesimal. Accordingly, up to ‘five’ The numbers ‘five’, ‘ten’ and ‘fifteen’ are body part analogies: compare cilax ‘five’ and si-lax ‘hand’, haalax ‘ten’ and ha-lax ‘hands’, and halaa’sidiix ‘fifteen’ (halax + sidiix ‘hands foot’). For the number ‘20’ the word u-nam (plural: ñan-nam ) for ‘king’ is used: this occurs also in other languages spoken in the same region ‒ Bayot and Joola Kaasa use [ə-ji] for both ‘twenty’ and ‘king’, Joola Kujireray and Joola Eegimaa have [ə-vːi]. From 20 to 99 the system of Gubëeher is vigesimal, i.e. based on multiples of u-nam ‘20’.

However, the numerals up to three are widely used in preference to Nepali numerals and many people, even young people, will have an idea of what four and five is in Bantawa. For numbers over five no consistent number system can be elicited. In the noun phrase, numerical or other quantification takes the first slot in the order of things. Numbers require the presence of qualifiers or classifiers. Classifiers are the counters that are used to define the unit of counting in the domain to which the head noun refers. Classifiers signal the semantic type of noun if it is individuated and therefore, classifiers put the nouns into classes. Classes are purely intuitive and if one knows the meaning of a word, by inference via the taxonomy of things, one can establish the classifier of choice. The properly quantified noun phrase then has the syntax: numeral-classifier (modifiers) noun (suffixes). All numbers over two may take the counter <-ka> (CNT), and numbers over three do so obligatorily. Although this morpheme has no obvious function, it is a productive suffix in the sense that also Nepali loan numerals get the affix. The counter suffix <-ka> cannot fruitfully be reduced to an incidental lexical regularity. nəu-ka-paŋ mɨna nine (N)-CNT-qhum manː ‘nine people’."

The digits 6-9 are transcribed phonetically as one word although they are more than likely a compound of the word for 5 (thought it drops its [w]) then the coordinate /iŋ/ which totally assimilates to the following consonant. The variation in the second vowel is consistent with some type of vowel harmony seen in other environments. The words originally given for 20 & 30 were later identified by the speakers as Bagirmi (a nearby language). The words for 100 and 1000 appear to have come from Hausa. The morpheme [ke] seen in numbers 11-19 was used in one other place as an adverb with the meaning of “more” or “still” (French: encore).

May 23, 2011.",,"The Baruya tally-system exhibits some unusual feathers. First, in the strict sense, Baruya has no numerals at all, i.e. there are no words in the tally-system which denote only numbers. Second, Baruya displaces a complex gender systems of masculine and feminine nouns and noun phrases. In tallying objects which belong to the feminine group, one set of tally-words will be employed and this is somewhat different to the set used for tally objects belonging to masculine group. The tally-word for 1 is 'da-', translated as 'this she'. The tally word for 2 is da-waai where 'da' is 'thus' and 'waai' is 'they(2)', i.e. the dual form of the 3rd personal person plural personal pronoun. Tallying 3 and 4 involved combinations of these. The reminding data are hand and foot tally-directions. The Baruya use their fingers, hands, toes and feet but are only specific on the lower numbers. e.g. one, two, two and one, two and two, one hand, one hand plus one, one hand plus two, two hands, two hands and a foot (more often two feet and a hand=15), one person, two people, a lot of people. There are no numeral roots as such. Demonstratives and articles and certain nouns are used in counting. These change according to gender and case. As counting is usually done on the fingers, by bringing the tops together, the demonstrative root da, 'this' is the most common root used. For the numbers 'one' and 'two' the article root' pɨ is most common. These stems have affixes which change according to person, number, gender and case. The only past instance where bigger numbers were counted was the number of war party. Salt bars are also counted, but this is only to a maximum of fifteen. Very rarely would anyone count from one to twenty. Seven is the largest individual number used in most circumstances. The present tendency is to use the English systems for anything higher than five."

Note however (i) that z is [s] – voiceless and that s is an apico-alveolar fricative; (ii) that when an i or u follows another vowel, you get a diphthong, e.g. lau '4’ is [law]; for twenty/20, you've got hogoi (Northern/Continental Basque) and hogei (Southern/Peninsular B): [hogoy / hogey]. ( By the way, I don't know if you use [j or [y] – for the front glide...) (iii) the double -rr- (an alveolar rhotic trill [r]) in berrogei, berrrehun is OK, but the there is only one r – a mere alveolar rhotic flap, in larogei (80) (the old Northern form was laur — just as the old Northern form for three was hirur). (iv) Finally, the etymology of mila is of course correct, but there is a Celtic etymology for hogei: cf. Breton ugent [ügent] (in many word, there is, historically, no initial h in many words that begin with this letter today, and it is not pronounced in Southern/Peninsular Basque).

But Awbono/Bayono here shows 23 positions. I believe counting above 23 entails reversing direction and counting back along the same positions, 22 becoming 24, 21 becoming 25, and so on. Very large numbers are signified by multiples of 23 (although I think it’s in a general sense, not exact multiples of 23), by motioning with the hand along the 23 positions in a fast broad sweep, and back again in reverse, and then again in forward, and again in reverse, until the desired number or approximate number is reached. Therefore 100 may be signified by 4 such sweeps: forward, backward, forward, backward, totaling 92, and then, if counting with exactness, perhaps counting individually the remaining 8 positions at the end. I am not sure about this last part regarding exactness though. They may suffice with an approximate represented by 4 sweeps."

Class 8 normally pairs with class 7, which is most often ki-. But Naami does have many noun pairs where the noun appears to take a zero prefix for sg and bi- for pl. So this could be consistent. Again, 100 belongs to gender 3/4, marked by labialization. Like other languages in our group, 10s are joined to 1s by ntʃə. Seven and nine appear to be complex forms with a prefix fuma- (or perhaps it's compounding).

The word di, on the other hands, is an allophone of the ri that links numerals with the noun that they modify, as we will see and the analysis explains why the word for 'eleven' is samfur sesr eser, without the linker ri, whereas the word for 'twelve' is samfur sesr ri suru. The numeral linker ri is not used to link a noun with the number eser, but only for the linking of a noun with one of the numbers two till nine. The words for 'eleven', twelve', 'twenty four' and 'nine hundred eleven' then can be analyzed as followsː 11. samfur sesr oser ː 'ten (and) one unit ' 12. samfur sesr di suru ː 'ten (and) NUM.LNK two unit ' 911. utin di siw samfur sesr oser ː 'hundred NUM.LNK nine ten unit one ', 'nine hundreds ten (and) one unit ' > nine hundred eleven. 10.0000. syaran samfur 1.000.000. juta (loanword from Indonesian) We can see in attributive position the cardinal numbers up to and including nine - except eser / oser 'one' - are linked to the preceding noun by the numeral linker ri.

There are five different dialects with some phonological and grammatical differences, but the numeral system is the same for all of them. (The basic numeral vocabulary is the same, too, with some differences in pronunciation due to the dialectal differences.). A note on orthography: ŋ and ɗ are used like their IPA counterparts, while ƴ represents the palatal implosive ʄ. ba means ''and''; orror is the plural of orro ''ten''. tayaaka is reminiscent of the feminine form of the adjective toyooko ''big'', although the feminine adjective is usually yaaka. I am not sure about the meaning of tape. ku in tape ku ɗuŋkuleek is a plural relative pronoun, while ɗuŋkuleek is a plural form of a different adjective which also means ''big''. For numbers over 99, many speakers tend to use the Chadian Arabic words instead (e.g. miya instead of orror orro). For talking about money, they use the same system as Chadian Arabic, referring to ''riyal'' instead of Central African Francs.

In Bugun for the addition process, a conjunctive marker na combines the numerals. The conjunctive marker na has a full form nana ‘and’. When numerals eleven to nineteen are built, the cardinal numeral suã ‘ten’ i.e. the base n combines with the conjunctive na ‘and’ and is followed by y i.e. the basic cardinals one to nine add up to the base numeral. For instance when dʒió ‘one’ follows suã na to form suã na dʒio ‘ten and one’ we have ‘eleven’. Native speakers use the weak form sna of suã na when they build the digits from eleven to nineteen by deleting the diphthong /uã/ to from a syllable initial cluster sna; In case of the cardinals 21 to 29 the conjunctive na follows the basic numeral itʃʰɑk ‘twenty’ with the numerals 1 to 9. In regular speech the conjunctive na is dropped by the native speakers. In Bugun the multiples from thirty to ninety are formed when sa a variant of the numeral súã ‘ten’ multiplies with the basic numerals ‘three’ to ‘nine’. The multiples of hundred are formed with the core numeral wiam ‘hundred’. Native speakers use the word hazrai for thousand instead of wiam suã. The numeral hazrai is derived from hazar ‘thousand’, a numeral found in most Indo-Aryan languages. Note that we observe that Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages. Also due to lack of active use of native language they can no longer distinguish tone variation nor can they use them."

The word -ngardapa below, if used in the third person, must be prefixed by one of the four noun class prefixes, an-, jin-, mun- or gun-, in agreement with the class of the noun to which the number applies. If used in the first or second person it must be prefixed with one of the intransitive verb person-number prefixes, in agreement with whatever the number applies to, see Glasgow, Kathleen, Burarra – Gun-Nartpa Dictionary with English Finder List, p.910, table 7. 2. For orthography used below see Glasgow, Kathleen, Burarra – Gun-Nartpa Dictionary with English Finder List, p. 10 3. In my opinion there are no numerals in Burarra. It has a word, ngardapa ‘alone / separate’ which when prefixed according to the class of the noun involved is used for ‘one’. The Burarra grammar has dual as well as singular and plural number so the concept of ‘two’ is conveyed by the use of the dual prefix, abirri- on the verb to be/stand, plus suffix -pa ‘repetition / constancy’, i.e. abirri-jirrapa. These two, - ngardapa and abirri-jirrapa can then be used in various combinations for the concepts of three, four, five, six, seven and so on. An alternative for ‘five’ is the phrase arr-ngardapa arr-murna, freely translated ‘the fingers on one of our hands’. Similarly two hands can be used for ten and the feet can come into it to go beyond ten These expressions can also be used in combination with the ‘one’ and ‘two’ above to get numerical accuracy, if required."

Also in the locality of Ujarrás in the southern part of the Pacific slope of the Talamanca Mountain Range (Buenos Aires county in the province of Puntarenas), due to migration from southwestern Talamanca at the end of the 19th century. The language has two main dialects: (1) the southern dialect is spoken in Ujarrás and southwestern Talamanca, (2) the northern dialect in northern Talamanca, and in the Limón, Matina, and Turrialba counties. Each dialect presents subdialects. Cabécar is a language with numeral classifiers. There are six numeral series (five of them with characteristic suffixes): (a) human, (b) round (suffix /-uʊ́/, (c) long (suffix /-tabà~-tabʊ̀/, (d) flat (suffix /-tkà~-tkʊ̀/), (e) sets (suffix /-dʒakà~-dʒʊkʊ̀/ , and (f) species-parts-weight units (suffix /-kà/). It must be pointed out that classes (b), (c) and (d) are used to count things that not necessarily have the corresponding shape. For example, class (b) is used to count seeds, pots, and years; class (c) is used to count mammals, snakes, alligators, fish, and trees, and class (d) birds, insects with wings, turtles, houses, months, and body ornaments such as earrings and necklaces. Series (a), (b) and (d) present a stem formative /-ɺ/ which occurs before the series suffix in (b) and (d). Due to analogy, some speakers include /-ɺ/ in some of the numerals of other series. Only five numeral roots occur: /é-/ 'one', /bó-/ 'two', / bãdʒã́-/ ([mã̀ɲã́-]) 'three', /pkí-/, /tkí-/, /hkí-/ (northern dialect), /tkɪ́-/ (southern dialect) 'four', /skẽ́-/ 'five'. Numerals from six to nine are formed with the phrase /sà huɺà/ 'our hand' followed by //kɪ̃́// 'plus' and the appropriate numeral from one to four. Numerals from ten to fourteen are formed with the phrase /sà huɺà bótkʊ̀/ 'our two hands' followed by /kɪ̃́/ 'plus' and the appropriate numeral from one to four. Numerals from fifteen to nineteen are formed with the phrase /sà huɺà bãdʒã́tkʊ̀/ 'three hands of ours' followed by /kɪ̃́/ 'plus' and the appropriate numeral from one to four. Twenty is /sà huɺà tkɪ́tkʊ̀/ (southern dialect), /sà huɺà pkítkʊ̀/, /sà huɺà tkítkʊ̀/ or /sà huɺà hkítkʊ̀/ (northern dialect). For quantities higher than 20, Margery Peña's 26 informants used Spanish numerals."

There are, however, some significant differences some of which are close to Eastern Cham and some which go beyond the sound changes of Cham. I cannot verify the phonetic accuracy of everything since I had only a couple of hours in the village on one occasion and was amazed at the many differences from Northern Roglai. For the numbers 1 and 2 there may be a difference in register since the aspirated t of 1 is from *sa and the one for 2 is from *dua. The same would be true for 8 and 9. Please change the number three to tlau which I just discovered looks like an aspirated t rather than tl. The number 5 has the shift of nasalized a to the high central vowel like Cham, but it also adds a velar nasal after the vowel. The r that I wrote in the word for 100 may be a voiced velar fricative or possibly a non-syllabic high unrounded central vowel as in Northern Roglai. I may have written an r because of my N. Roglai influence although in that environment, N. Roglai has no consonant but only a lengthening of the vowel. I see that I wrote a voiced velar fricative in other words in Cat Gia words."

The counting system described by Cathcart (""from little finger on the left hand, coming across to the thumb, and then touching the thumb on the right..."") is actually the way that missionaries have taught the Christianized indigenous people to count. The way used by elders (who had been in less contact/less Christianized) is in fact drastically different. For expressing ""one/two"", elders join together index finger + heart/middle finger (see picture 1). It is consistent with the cultural system of exchanging partners, as the ideal individual is conceived as minimally a couple. Following, to represent ""three"", index and middle fingers are joint together, while the ring finger is left up but not touching the other two (see picture 2). This, in most translations of the languages of the area, can be translated as (or near to) 'one with no companion/one with no friend'. Number 'four' is expressed by joining index and middle fingers on one side, and ring and little finger joined together aside (see picture 3). In most languages of the area this is expressed by a concept near to 'two having a friend/companion). Number five is expressed by leaving thumb finger alone, while index and middle finger are joined together, and ring and little finger joined together as well (see picture 4). Number six (picture 5), is expressed by joining thumb finger of one hand with thumb finger of the other, index and middle finger joined together, and ring and little finger joined together. So on, with number 7, 8, 9, 10. I have not encountered terms to refer to concepts as 20, 40, 50, 100. Instead, terms in Spanish are used. Usually any concept beyond 5 is expressed with Spanish loans.

Counting from the little finger on the left hand, coming across to the thumb, and then touching the thumb on the right hand and so forth, each finger, and then each toes, is elevated, after having been closed as a unit. The numbers above are neutral. However, an animate suffix (wã) may be added. ''Two'' (referring to people) is therefore čéne-wã. There are alternate forms for 20, 40, 50 and 100 by using person as followsː 20. bík kã́ak-íʔ hítča beed-íʔ (litː one person's (hands and) feet complete ). 40. čéne kã́ak-íʔ hítča beed-iʔ (litː two people's (hands and) feet complete ). 50. čéne kã́ak-íʔ hítča beed bíʔ kã́ak-íʔ téiʔya čɨ̃íʔni (litː two people's feet complete, another person's hand touching ).

Because of the length of the names of the other numbers and fact that different people may say them a little bit different, normally the appropriate numbers of fingers and toes are shown and the person says 'bói', which means ''many''. Anything over 15 or 20 is usually treated as ''many''. Only a few of the old people even try to express other quantities using specific words. Among those young people who have studied a little of arithmetic, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 20 may be spoken of using either Cacua term or Spanish word, but for any other number the Spanish word is always use."

Anything given for numbers higher than that varies depending upon the person and the occasion. Most often, for example when asked how many children they have, a person will hold out their right hand, palm up with their fingers extended, and beginning with the little finger will use the other hand to bring the finger to the palm, saying something like, “There is this one, and this one, and this one….” and finishing with “...there are many” (chooca oshequi). If they have more than five, they continue the process on the left hand. For the number three, sometimes I have been given “otsipatapojaque” or “otsipatapojatsica” meaning basically something like “it’s another one”. Once or twice I have heard “mavitetapojatsica” after “mavite”. The word listed below for four, “guijatapojiroca”, means “the one that follows it”. “Teroncapoja” means “it is finished”, i.e. those are all the fingers on one hand. Other words sometimes used for five: apapacoro / apavacoro ”one hand” teroncavacotanaca “one hand is finished”. The Caquintes apparently had no need to develop a precise numbering system since they had no commerce and no money. They lived by gardening, hunting and fishing, as most still do. Since having contact with non-Caquintes and wanting to go to school, they have adopted the Spanish numbers, but often prefer to alter the pronunciation to better fit their own phonology. Those with more contact with Spanish use the Spanish pronunciation. My wife and I began studying the Caquinte language in 1976 at the invitation of those who founded what is now the village of Kitepampani (Quitepampani). A few of the people had learned basic reading and writing in the Matsigenka schools and were tentatively using the Matsigenka orthography for their own language, but requested an orthography that was more like Spanish, saying that it would make it easier for the children to learn Spanish. For syllables that sound the same or very similar in Spanish and Caquinte, they wanted to be able to write them the same way in both languages. The Peruvian Ministry of Education approved the orthography and a number of primers and other books were published. Using c/qu instead of k, is of course is a bit less “economical”, but most have been happy with their choice and have been using it successfully for more than 30 years. There are some now who want to change the orthography and are planning meetings to discuss the issue again."

Also, this data comes from one speaker, and I consider it tentative, subject to future research -- so please use it at your discretion given those considerations. Regarding the spelling of the language, there is some debate about whether the language should be spelt Kakinte or Caquinte, the latter being a Spanish-based spelling. The nearby related language of Matsigenka employs orthographic <k> in its orthography, but Kakinte leaders indicate that they disprefer the use of <k> in the name of the language, preferring instead the spelling <Caquinte>. However, they like <k> in the spelling of the community name Kitepámpani. It is my impression that most feelings about orthography stem from that used in the translation of the Bible into Kakinte by SIL linguist Kenneth Swift. However, it is unknown to me if community members were involved in the decision-making process that brought about that orthography. I summarize this in order to say, please use either spelling at your discretion. For the time being I am personally employing the spelling <Kakinte> (with its various ramifications throughout the language), as it is a more ""economical"" (i.e., requires fewer graphemes) orthography."

The same process is restored to for eight, and for nine the Carriers unconsciously conform to the Greek way, sayingː one is lacking ( to have both hands entirely used, that is to make ten). The numbers after ten are obtained by adding thereto by adding ʔonʔat, plus and the numbers it may be desired to express, thus xʷʌniz̠yai ʔonʔat ʔiło, ten plus one ː eleven. For twenty the Carriers sayː twice ten nat xʷʌniz̠yai.

(2) ə represents a high-central vowel which in multi-syllabic words shifts slightly in the direction of the vowel of the following syllable.

The data was supplied by Ms. Veronica Atin, who was a student at UWA for a period overlapping with my retirement. Some notes on these data: 1. The status of final glottal stops in Dusun languages is problematic. Some investigators (like Paul Kroeger, in his work on Kimaragang) believe them to be phonemic, but I am far from convinced that this is the case. When Ms. Atin first gave me data on the numerals, she did so in written form. She had final glottal stops–which she rendered as apostrophe–in exactly those numerals in which they appear in the Kadazan-Dusun dictionary (as reflected in your Coastal Kadazan data). Ms Atin did tend to be influenced by that dictionary when she was uncertain. In general, she was inconsistent in transcribing final glottal stops, as I was in hearing them. A UWA honours student, whose honours dissertation used Dusun data from a field methods class held after I'd retired, had a similar problem to mine with glottal stop, and didn't use it in her renderings of Central Dusun numerals. Even Paul Kroeger, who regards glottal stop as phonemic in the related Dusun language Kimaragang, talks about it as optional in some environments. So suit yourself regarding whether to put it in or leave it out in the above data. 2. The form soribu 'one thousand' is a bit of a problem. It is a reflex of PMP *Ribu 'thousand', and could be a native Dusun form. It could also be a borrowing from Malay seribu. (Malay borrowing are common in Dusun languages, since Malay is replacing Dusun in many functions. Given the close genetic relationship between Malay and Dusun languages, borrowings are not always obvious.) There is another Central Dusun root rioŋ 'thousand' that popped up once in my data, but doesn't seem to be the usual form for 'thousand'. The prefix so- 'one' is also etymologically ambiguous: maybe Dusun and maybe Malay. It alternates with a prefix soŋ- 'one', which is the more frequent in my data. Both are occasionally found with the same root e.g. soikar ~ songikar 'an acre'."

The main problem about Chamacoco is that my new data are too new to say more about Chamacoco numeral system. I mean that nowadays they use their only Spanish numbers; the native numbers survive only for numers 'one' and 'two', as you can see in Ulrich & Ulrich (2000). Unfortunately, in my field-research activity this information has been confirmed. I provide you the numbers in chamacoco trascription by Ulrich & Ulrich and in IPA (from my field-work). sohmɨ̃ra [tsom̥ɨ'ɹa] or nohmɨra [nom̥ɨ'ɹa], there is no difference between sohmɨ̃ra and nohmɨra), osiyer 'two' [osi'je?] (this is the unmarked form they use to count and it is also the form used to refer to a masculin noun, if they refer to a feminine noun, they will use otiyer [oti'jeɹ]. Number ‘one’ has a rich morphological inflection I’m going to describe in my Phd thesis. Only (very) old people remember the original number system, which is very similar to that attested in Baldus (1932: 394).1 Apart from still surviving sohmɨ̃ra and osiyer, numbers up than two were formed from the combination of three elements: toho ‘one’, arĩ ‘two’ and sharĩ ‘two’; the numeral system was indeed based on the addition of ‘two’ and ‘one’. For instance, three was arĩ toho (literally ‘two-one’); ‘four’ was arĩ sharĩ (literally ‘two-two’). These elements seem to have a rigid order: arĩ is used only at the beginning of a series, while in all the other cases sharĩ is used; if the number is odd, the last element is obligatorily toho ‘one’. In (a) the original number system is reported. Phonetic transcription: arĩ [ã'ɹĩ], sharĩ [ʃã'ɹĩ], toho ['tɔho]. There is then a remarkable difference among Chamacoco and Ayoreo in number system (especially in the surviving of the numer system) although they are in the same linguist family. Here I have to point out that Ayoreo were first contacted in the 40's of the XX century and there are still few Ayoreo who have never been contacted; on the other hand, Chamacoco were contacted at the turn of the XIX century, so that this language has already lost many of the original elements of the Zamucoan family.

However, it might note that remnant of the old Algonquian system of numbers formation can still be seen in Cheyenne. For instant, 6 is built up as something like 1 + 5, 7 = 2 + 5, 8 = 3 + 5. There does not appear to be any such etymological connection between 9 and 4. The 10's ( 20, 30, etc) are constructed from the basic morphemes plus a suffix which indicates 10's, hence 20 = 2 x 10, 30 = 3 x 10, etc. There are several Cheyenne numbers sets for telling how many times, objects and so on. The above set is used for numbers of times but often used for serial counting. Basically, Cheyenne people can can count this way up to 2000, but it becomes increasingly difficult to find certainty or agreement among Cheyenne speakers for higher numbers. Typically, Cheyenne speakers will use English numbers for higher numbers, for instance, numbers above 100. However, some speakers still like to create the higher numbers in Cheyenne. It is recommended that, because of this present-day situation with the numbers, schoolchildren not be taught detailed numbers above approximately numbers 100.

Numbers from 15 through 19 are formed by 15 plus 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. The Chicahuaxtla Triqui words for numbers in the hundreds, thousands and in the millions are adopted from the Spanish words <ciento> [ˈsʝen̪.to] ‘(one) hundred’, <mil> [mil] ‘(one) thousand’ and <millón> [mi.ˈʝon], respectively. Cardinal forms appear in pre-noun position whereas ordinal numbers are after the noun. The phonemes listed may occur in word-initial position with the exception of /p/, which is rare and only found in word medial position (cf. lupi [lupi] 'guajolote/turkey') and /h/, which is only found as a final syllable coda. The phonemes /p/ and /b/ (and its prenasalized conditioned variant [mb]) are not native to Chicahuaxtla Triqui and surface only in Spanish loanwords. Spanish loanwords beginning with <p> are frequently realized as /b/ in Chicahuaxtla Triqui, for example: <besu> [mbe4suː] < ‘peso’ (< SP [ˈpe.so]); <belêtu> [ᵐbele4t̪uː3] < ‘pleito’ (< SP [ˈp͡lei̯.t̪o] ‘lawsuit’ or ‘dispute’). Similar to Spanish, /b d ɡ/ in intervocalic position may be pronounced as approximants or non-fricative continuants [β ð ɣ], however, after nasals they are articulated as stops. However, this is not universal for all native speakers of Chicahuaxtla Triqui. Rhotic /r/ in word initial position is most commonly pronounced as a voiced alveolar trill [r] but may also occur as a voiceless alveolar trill [r̥] or may be assibilated [rᶾ]. Some speakers pronounce word-initial /r/ as [dr] (Elliott, Sandoval Cruz & Santiago Rojas 2012). /r/ in intervocalic position may be pronounced as a voiced alveolar flap [ɾ] but may be assibilated or trilled in this environment by some speakers of the language. Chicahuaxtla Triqui has fortis-lenis contrasts in word-initial position for the following phonemes /m mː n nː ʝ ʝː w wː/. We found only one instance of the fortis voiced alveolar lateral [lː]: <ma lê’> [ma32 lːe4ʔ] ‘hello, sister’, a salutation used only among women. Chichuaxtla Triqui has fourteen vowels: seven oral vowels /i e ɯ ə a u o/ and seven nasals vowels /ĩ ẽ ɯ̃ ə̃ ã ũ õ/. Of the nasal vowels, [ĩ ã ɯ̃ ũ] are more common whereas [ẽ ə̃ õ] are rare. Similar to the Copala and Itunyoso Triqui variants (Hollenbach 1977; DiCanio 2010), there are no diphthongs in Chicahuaxtla Triqui. Adjacent vowels surface only in word final syllables in Chicahauxtla Triqui and are always pronounced in hiatus, each in its own syllable. Referencesː"

Humans and certain parts of the human body; 2. Concave objects; 3. Long objects; 4. Round objects; 5. Objects capable of containing other objects; 6. Flat objects; 7. Houses; 8. Plants; 9. Corncobs. The above numbers are used to count 'long objects'. It includes the different expressions used to express the same quantity. It seems that Chimila numerical system is ruled by a parity principle which grants greater importance to the odd or even quality of the groups counted than to the definition of an exact numerical base. Native speakers always use the same numerals to count to five. Up to five several formulas are employed. If it is not mandatory to specify the quantity, as frequently happens, just the odd or even quality of the group being counted is marked. It is worth noting that the fourth numeral is employed to express even quantities and the fifth to indicate the odd ones. Often speakers use an expression for odd or even and, at the same time, they specify the exact number with their fingers."

The thousand ''lɪmíl'' is a loan from French. The American Phonetic symbols used here areː Nasalization is indicated with a ''hook'' underneath the vowel COMMENTS: • From 1–10, there is a separate set of numerals for counting humans. (Syncretism for '9'.) • Human numerals involve nasality or/and -ni, which may be related to the noun dëne 'person'. Overtly dëne in nádëne 'two people'. • ""There is a great deal of variability in pronunciation even within the same community."" (Cook 2004:110). According to my observations, even more variability than indicated above. Especially with respect to nasality, in both the human and nonhuman numerals. Also some variation between vowels i and e, and some shortening of forms. • Cook says the system up to 10 is quinary: Underived terms for 1–5, but 6 is 'three on three' and 8 is 'four on four' (Cook 2004:110). More literally, 6 is 'three on each other' and 8 is 'four on each other'. E.g. 6: Ɂełe- RECIPROCAL, k’é 'on', taghe 'three'. • 11–19: ""are formed by adding ch’adhëł/Ɂadhëł to the basic forms 'one' to 'nine' "" (Cook 2004:110). • 10, 20, 30, etc.: expressed as multiples of 10 (the term for the factor plus the term for 10). E.g., 20 = nónéna < náke 'two' or perhaps náh 'twice' + honéna 'ten'. Cook paraphrases as 'two tens' (20), 'three tens' (30), etc. Cf. Cook 2004, Elford & Elford 1998. • Counting single digits from twenty: The decimal base plus the postposition ts’n 'towards' plus the single digit. Cf. Cook 2004, Elford & Elford 1998. • 100, 200, etc: Expressed as multiples of 100. The factor Ɂįłághe is often left out in the word for 100: Just honénóna. Same pattern with 1000, 2000, etc. • Words for 100: behchënaze 'little sled' [behchën 'sled' + -aze DIMINUTIVE] (cf. Cook 2004, where it is beshchënaze, not sure if this is a typo); honénóna possibly from honéna + honéna 'ten tens'. Not sure of etymology of honéłdą. • Words for 1000: dechënchogh ’big stick’ [dechën 'stick', -chogh AUGMENTATIVE] (cf. Cook 2004); lamíl borrowed from French mille. • Syntactically, numerals can modify a noun (usually preceding the noun), or they can stand alone. Not sure if ellipsis is involved when numerals occur without noun, or if they function like nouns. I think they are like nouns. WHAT MIGHT ALSO INTEREST YOU: You can take a look at the older forms of the numerals in Legoff 1889: Legoff, Laurent. 1889. Grammaire de la langue Montagnaise. Montréal, Québec: 50, Rue de Cotte, 50. [Montagnais is the French name of the language.] 3 Numerals are discussed on p. 103ff. The orthography is a bit idiosyncratic (developed by a French speaker without recourse to the IPA); it is explained on p. 13ff. I am attaching the relevant pages as PDF. These older forms of the numerals are longer, and I think especially in the cases of 7 and 9 they may reveal an etymology which is no longer transparent in the contemporary forms. Nasalization is indicated with a ''hook'' underneath the vowels, uses a few digraphs in place of single letters, and also nasality is written below the vowel, instead of on top. This language has contrastive nasality and four contrastive tones (high, low, rising, and falling), double vowel, e.g. ""oo"" is a long vowel [o:]. Thus, a falling tone is written as óo in Tetsǫ́ǫt'ıné and oò ın Wıı̀lıı̀deh, whıle a rısıng tone ıs wrıtten oó ın Tetsǫ́ǫt'ıné and òo ın Wıı̀lıı̀deh: one languages is ""high marked"" while the other is ""low marked,"" so the default tone is left unwritten in each language. The digraphs are: gh = velar or uvular voiced fricative sh = alveopalatal voiceless fricative zh = alveopalatal voiced fricative th = interdental voiceless fricative dh = interdental voiced fricative, etc. Note that the Phonetic transcriptions between IPA and American Phonetic Notationsː 1. gh = IPA [ʁ ], voiced velar fricative. 2. dh = IPA [ð], voiced interdentally fricative. 3. ɬ = IPA [ɬ], voiced lateral fricative. 4. š = IPA [ʃ], voiceless post-alveolar fricative. 5. tɬ = IPA [tɬ], voiceless lateral affricate. 6. tčʼ = IPA [tʃʼ], voiceless ejective affricate. 7. ts = IPA [ts], voiceless dental affricate. 8. tsʼ =IPA [tsʼ], voiceless ejective affricate 9.

Stops in a consonant cluster with h as the initial radical (hp, ht, hk) are unaspirated and lax. Gemination in stops only occurs intervocalically. Intervocalic single, non-geminating stops are lax, unaspirated, and generally voiced. The difference between voiced stops b and d (allophones of m and n) and voiceless stops is hardly discernible when following a fricative, since both are unaspirated and lax. The phoneme k has a palatalized allophone [kʲ] that occurs after i, e, ch and sh, often word-finally. Fricatives are tense; they are only lax when intervocalic. Palatal sh is often voiced intervocalically; s is sometimes voiced intervocalically; x is never voiced. The alveolar fricative /s/ has an optional allophone /h/ in phrase-initial position: sáapa ""what"" > [háapa] sapée ""who"" > [hapée] Sonorants voiced /m/ and /n/ have three allophones: w and l intervocalically, b and d word initially and following an obstruent, and m and n in all other conditions. In conservative speech, l is realized as a tapped r, however in general cases it is realized as l, perhaps in due part to the influence of English. Word initially, b is optional for /m/, though b is more commonly realized. The glottal sonorant /h/ assimilates to the nasality of the following segment, but retains its voicelessness. When following i or e or preceding ch, /h/ may be realized as an alveopalatal fricative. Crow Vowel Chartː Front Central Back Close i, iː u, uː Mid eː oː Open a, aː There are diphthongsː ia, ua and ea. Stress in Crow is phonemic. The position of the stress in the stem is determined lexically. In general, morphemes, including virtually all noun and verbal stems, are inherently stressed. There are two regular qualifications: (1) stress placement in active verb inflectional paradigms in predictable from conjugation, and (2) accent short vowels in a word-initial syllable are generally followed by a consonant cluster, while accented long vowels in a word-initial syllable are generally followed by a single consonant. If a vowel is short, it may be stressed or unstressed. If long, it may be stressed or unstressed; if stressed, the stress falling on either mora of the long vowel. With diphthongs, either the long vowel or the off-glide may bear the stress. Stress helps predict the tones of all the vowels in a word: stressed vowels are high in pitch; all vowels following the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all short vowels preceding the stressed vowel are low in pitch; all long vowels preceding the stressed vowel are high in pitch; short vowels occurring between a long vowel and the accented vowel assimilate to a high pitch."

Usually the Damal would say of 200 “maralingam waiyuk” “impossible to count” or “maratum kama” “can’t count.” However, my informants said that when it is necessary to keep track of large numbers (like shells in bride price payments), they would put down a stick representing 10, and when there were ten sticks, they would tie them together into a bundle. 200 then would be two bundles of sticks, each stick representing 10 of the item counted. These sticks would be small twigs, and it should be noted that each stick then represents one man’s hands (or 10 fingers). It was able today to meet with 2 Damal informants to check the tones on the Damal numeral system. In the Damal script you will find tones marked with a system of 4 phonemic tones, marked as follows: Low tone, marked with the grave accent: à Mid tone, marked with the macronː ā High tone, marked with the acute accent: á Glide tone from mid to low tone, marked with the circumflex: â Dr. John David Ellenberger told me (May 22, 2014) now because the Damal tribe has largely adopted the Indonesian numeral system figures (1-10), for the numbers over five.

In 1960 when we began our work with the Dano people, they were already beginning to use English numbers (in or adapted from the forms found in either Pidgin English or in standard English) in preference to their own more cumbersome system, though they continued to use their own numbers up to and including four or five and probably are still doing that. So our knowledge of their own system for numbers higher than four/five probably comes more from elicited data than from naturally occurring data. However, even at that early date people could count in scores. They could say “one man’s hands and feet finished” for twenty or “two men’s hands and feet finished” for forty. Or they could substitute ‘pounds’ [£1 = 20 (shillings)] for men, so that in answer to a “how many” question, they might answer “two pound” meaning forty. Theoretically their system could be extended ad infinitum but in practice I can remember only one occasion when a man used it in conversation with me for a number greater than ten. He told me that he had had “our hand both sides finished and four on our foot at one side” (meaning fourteen) wives and he bent and took hold of the toe next to the big toe on one of his feet to demonstrate (Actually, I have sometimes seen younger people do this when speaking to older or more “uneducated” people of a number between five and twenty). I should say that counting starts from the little finger on one hand and progresses towards the thumb. Six is indicated by wrapping the fingers of one hand around the little finger of the other hand (I cannot remember if there is any specific preference about which hand, right or left, is used first). So when counting gets to the foot it starts from the little toe and proceeds towards the big toe. I must add that there can be minor variations in the wording for the more complex numbers in the table above. For example people might insert the verb ‘jump’ into the expression as in Ellis Deibler’s Alekano table, or they might say ”our hand on this side being finished, at our hand on that side one” with no verb connected with the “one”."

Also, the number 'forty' has an alternate form that is 'two' and 'twenty'. This alternative form appears to be a remnant of the vigesimal system that D. D. Sharma mentioned before. Contrastive tone is found in Darma, but it is attested in a limited number of words. Whether what I find is an example of tonogenesis or the loss of tone, I cannot definitively say. Based on my experience in the Darma community, I would guess that tone is being lost. The paucity of minimal pairs, the difficulty I had in getting speakers to provide words with tone, along with the fact that younger speakers are generally unable to produce tone distinctions in the few words that I have documented with tone all lead me to believe that tone is being lost. I find that there is a two tone contrast: high versus low. The high tone is marked with an acute The high tone is marked with an acute accent above the vowel [ á ] and low tone is unmarked. In general, speakers are unable to articulate how ‘hand’ la and ‘moon’ lá are different; meaning the concept of tone is not familiar to the community. This is not surprising considering the Indo-Aryan languages that are spoken in the area are not tonal."

Deuri has prefixes to form the core numeral and in Deuri the prefix mu- is obligatory and the base numerals take the mu- prefix to form the core numerals in the above table. The cardinal numeral tʃa and za ’one’ in Deuri are variants, native speakers alternately use both the forms. Deuri has a prefix kuwa- which helps in constructing higher digits twenty onwards in the language. In Deuri numbers 11 to 19 is built by addition of the basic numerals 1 to 9 to 10. Unlike Bugun, Deuri does not take a conjunctive marker. The prefix mu- affixes to the numbers built by this process. For instance muduga ‘ten’ combines with muza ‘one’ to build the cardinal ‘eleven’. Deuri numerals above 19 take the prefix kowa-. We have the cardinals 20 to 29. The cardinals from 21t o 29 are instance of addition; where the basic cardinals 1 to 9 add up kuwɑ-tʃɑ ‘twenty’. This basic numeral is derived by multiplication kowa x tʃa ‘20 x 1’. The cardinal ‘twenty’ derived by this process is combined with the basic numerals ‘one’ to ‘nine’ to build the higher digits. In Deuri we have the instance of the base numeral n multiplying x and then y is added to build the higher digit. It is to be noted that to form ‘twenty’ the language uses one of the variants for ‘one’ tʃa. And to form the next higher digit the other variant muza ‘one’ is used. Thus ‘twenty one’ in Deuri is formed by the addition of kowatʃa ‘twenty’ to muza ‘one’; In Deuri the peripheral numerals: three, five, seven and nine suffixes to kuwa- to build the odd multiple numerals. In the derivation of the odd multiples a vowel or a consonant or syllable is dropped from the base numerals. Unlike Dzongkha multiple formation, Deuri odd multiples a derived by division. kuwa- multiplies with the base numeral muwa ‘five’ to give kuwamuwa ‘hundred’. In Table 14, with the dropping of the vowel we have kuwamu ‘fifty’. The same is true for the multiple thirty, kuwaŋda is sixty and kuwada with the drop of the velar nasal /ŋ / becomes ‘thirty’. The phoneme or syllable within parenthesis is obligatorily dropped to build the odd multiples. The odd numerals (30, 50, 70 and 90) are a combination of 20 + the (un-prefixed) base numeral, and that the ‘base numeral’ is disyllabic and one syllable is dropped – the first syllable in some case and the last syllable in others. Why this happens we don’t know and this needs further investigation. Note that Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages. Also due to lack of active use of native language they can no longer distinguish tone variation nor can they use them. Note that we observe that Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Deuri cardinals do not show tone. Jacquesson (2005) remarks “tonal opposition is dying in Deuri, it certainly was prosperous although it is difficult to locate chronologically”."

The names do not correspond to any coherent dialect (or sociolect) division. Kotia Oriya was used by SIL people in the 70s, as they seem to have worked with people from the Kotia community. Except for early publications of SIL, I haven't seen it used for the language. As for the differences between my list and the Adivasi Oriya list: Vowel length has been reported to be contrastive for some varieties of Desia/Adivasi Oriya, but I have not found a variety for that this is true. It may be true for the varieties of the Araku Valley where the SIL people did most of their work in the 70s, but looking at the various materials from the Araku Valley, I doubt that it is. I don't know of any claim that aspiration would be contrastive in any variety of Desia/Adivasi Oriya, so I suspect that the aspiration in the Adivasi Oriya list is non-phonemic. In all varieties I know, all unvoiced stops are aspirated and all voiced stops are not. GoTek and duiTa are definite (or maybe specific) forms of the numerals ek and dui. There is no reason to list them only for one and two. You can add the affix or clitic -Ta to any numeral, e.g. tinTa and pantsTa and dosTa are all correct and frequently used numerals. manek for hundred has been reported for Desia/Adivasi Oriya, but it is a volume measure – one ""man"", a type of measuring container for grains and I have not been able to verify its use as a numeral. As far as I have seen it used, it is always used as a non-numerical quantifiers, similar to ""lots of"" or ""a bunch"".

In most contemporary dialects of southern Domari (spoken in Palestine and Jordan), numerals above five have been replaced by Arabic forms (Matras 2012). The original system was nevertheless documented by Macalister (1914:18-19). Forms are given respecting Macalister’s transcription: Domari is an Indic language spoken by the Dōm, commonly described as the ''Gypsies'' of the Middle-East. The m are originally service-providing itinerant communities who left India at an early stage and spread across the Middle-East. The term m is itself cognate with the Indian caste name Dōm which is still widely used in India to designate a variety of peripatetic communities. Amongst the Indic languages spoken outside the Indian subcontinent, the most well-known and studied is Romani, the language of the European Roma. The Lom, located in Armenia and also in parts of Eastern Turkey, also spoke a fully-fledged Indic language but it has only survived as a lexicon within an Armenian matrix (Voskanian 2002). Domaaki and Parya are also diasporic Indic languages spoken outside or at the periphery of India but they remained typologically closer to Central Indo-Aryan languages.3 Although the historical links between Romani and Domari are still to a large extent obscure, it is now accepted that they are not sister-languages or even dialects of the same language.

For example, twenty-four pigs could be ngui ndu gonia rabagia ‘one ngui and ten extra’ (I don’t know the meaning of gonia here). Fourteen lots of fourteen is nguingui. My consultants found it difficult to agree on exactly how counting would proceed after this number, although there was general consensus that fifteen lots of fourteen could be nguingui ndu-da malura ‘one fourteen at/on one nguingui’. There is a separate system for counting coin/paper money which uses the number words in combination with the units kuni ‘10 toea’, rebu ‘50 toea’ and pane ‘2 kina’. Duna speakers today use Tok Pisin and/or English numbers quite extensively but people also employ Duna numerals within a base ten framework. For example, ‘30’ could be tedi(bela) from English/Tok Pisin or rabagia iduba, ‘ten three’. The number ‘16’ could be English/Tok Pisin sikstin or rabagia ndu gonia raga ‘one ten and six’. Words for larger base ten units are borrowed into the language, for example, ‘100’ might be said as wan handred(i) or handredi ndu.

dura1244-1,"Dura, Nepal",dura1244,Dura,drq,Eurasia,28.173,84.435,Sino-Tibetan,Dura-Nepal.htm,"Mr. Nicolas Schorer, PhD Students, Department of Linguistics, Bern University, Switzerland, August 8, 2015.",,"Dura has a decimal system based on simple non-compound forms fro all numbers below 'ten'. The numbers from 'ten' to 'twenty' are unattested. In this denary system, tens ('twenty', 'thirty') are transparent compound numbers, e.g. jʰim-tʰi 'twenty' (lit. 'two-ten', meaning 2 x 10). Though unattested in the data, words for 'forty, fifty, sixty' etc. are expected to be formed regularly, e.g. kum-tʰi fifty. Dura has only reserved the number 'one; from Tibeto-Burman origin. The Indo-Aryan loans are easily sorted out: yāvo ‘one’, duvo, duɖa ‘two’ (the latter evidently reflecting the Nepali classifier for inanimate objects), tiyā ‘three’, jʰārā ‘four’ pā̃c ‘five’ as well as probably cyām ‘six’ and syām ‘seven’. The different Dura forms for ‘two’ are borrowed from the Nepali numerals dui ‘two’ and dui-ʈā ‘two pieces’. Similarly borrowed from Nepali are tiyā < tīn ‘three’, jʰārā < cār ‘four’, pā̃c <pā̃c ‘five’, cyām < cʰa ‘six’ and syām <sāt ‘seven’. The indigenous numbers, provided as they were via Facebook, are fascinating in some respects and warrant further discussion. These numerals are particularly noteworthy for preserving a closed syllable structure, mostly a semantically opaque -m#. Possible cognates for liŋa ‘zero’ can be detected in numerous branches of Tibeto-Burman, e.g Bai liɯ⁴², Hani (Southern Loloish) liŋ³¹, Qiangic (Guiqiong lĩ³³, Pumi lẽ¹³), Tujia leng³ and Black Lahu lɛ³³, all ‘zero’. It is seemingly unattested in Bodic languages surrounding the traditional Dura-speaking area. The numeral nām ‘one’ appears to be truly unique to Dura and does not have any cognates in other languages, future research pending. On the other hand, the prefixed di- is an uncontroversial reflex of what is reconstructed on STEDT as Proto-Tibeto-Burman *tyik ‘one’. This prefix is only attested in Dura temporal adverbs such as di-blā ‘once’ and di-syāra ‘one moment’. kya-u (-u being a nominaliser) is translated into Nepali as euʈā ‘one piece’. Number ‘two’, jʰim, is not relatable to Proto-Tibeto-Burman, Numbers ‘three’ and ‘four’ are again unproblematic from a Proto-Tibeto-Burman perspective, cf. Proto-Tibeto-Burman *g-sum, Tibetan *gsum, Proto-Tamangic ᴮsom, Chepang sum, Limbu sum si and Burmese sùm. Most languages retain a rounded vowel, yet Dura is noteworthy in having an orthographic unrounded central vowel <ā> just like Lisu (Loloish) sa, Bai sã⁵⁵, Modern Chinese sān, rGyalrong kǝ sam and Bahing (Kiranti) sam ne, all ‘three’. For the numeral pim ‘four’ compare Proto-Tibeto-Burman *b-liy~b-lǝy, Tibetan bʑi, Proto-Tamangic ᴮbli, Proto-Tani *pri, Chepang plǝy, Limbu li si, Burmese lè etc. Dura seems to have simplified the cluster and preserves only the bilabial prefix, a feat it apparently shares with Tsangla phi, Newar pe, and all of Western Himalayish, as exemplified in Pattani, Darma, Byangsi, Chaudangsi pi and Kanauri pö. Unfortunately, no full set of inherited numerals is preserved in Kham, which uses Nepali cār ‘four’ instead and does therefore not lend itself to a comparison. The loss of the lateral approximant is unusual in the sense that Dura otherwise allows such consonant clusters. A not wholly dissimilar cluster simplification has occurred in Magar, which has buli with an epenthetic rounded vowel /u/. Perhaps then, the labial prefix reconstructed for this etymon was in fact realised as a minor syllable *bə- given the sesquisyllabic nature of roots postulated for Proto-Tibeto-Burman. kum and mācā ‘five’ (the latter perhaps ‘(one) above four’ composed of mā- ‘up, above, uphill’ and IA cār) are noteworthy given that reflexes of Proto-Tibeto-Burman *-ŋa ‘five’ are found in almost all languages of the family except Dura. Dura kum ‘five’ is likely to be derived from kuru ‘hand’. Such a metonymic use of ‘hand’ for ‘five’ is likewise attested in Kham, compare for instance sohmlo kwi: ‘three hands’ = ‘fifteen’ (Watters 2002: 179). It is indeed quite striking how different some of the Dura numerals are from anything found in adjacent Bodic languages: Potential cognates of him ‘eight’ are found only in far-away Namuyi (Qiangic) hĩ³³, Yi (Northern Loloish) hi⁵⁵, Black Lahu hí and Lisu he⁴¹. tum ‘nine’ is reminiscent of Tibetan dgu, Tshona (East Bodic) tu³¹ ku³¹ and Mongsen Ao thuku104, while potential cognates of tʰim ‘ten’ are known from Dhimal te-, and Nung (Nungic) thi³¹ mɯ³¹. This numeral is probably derived from ‘one’, cf. PTB *tyik ‘one’. In Dura, we encounter two words for ‘hundred’, tʰiŋganā and kātʰerāgo, both containing a numeral tʰi-~tʰe- ‘one’ which is further preceded by the velar prefix *k- in the latter form. While the former suffixed element is not transparent, -rāgo is surely derived from Proto-Tibeto-Burman: PTB *r-gya > *rə-gyā > rā-go ‘hundred’ (also compare Written Tibetan brgya).

The vowel system of Arrernte is unusual in that there are only two contrastive vowel phonemes, /a/ and /ə/. Two-vowel systems are very rare worldwide, but are also found in some Northwest Caucasian languages. It seems that the vowel system derives from an earlier one with more phonemes, but after the development of labialized consonants in the vicinity of round vowels, the vowels lost their roundedness/backness distinction, merging into just two phonemes. There is no allophonic variation in different consonantal contexts for the vowels. Instead, the phonemes can be realized by various different articulations in free variation. For example, the phoneme /ə/ can be pronounced as [ɪ ~ e ~ ə ~ ʊ] in any context. The syllable structure of Arrernte is argued to be VC(C), with obligatory codas and no onsets Plural morphemes are suppletive for monosyllabic and bisyllabic words in the structure of VC and VC(C)VC respectively. Stress falls on the first nucleus preceded by a consonant, and the frequentative is formed by reduplicating the final VC portion of the verb stem.

This type of system is apparently quite common in Papua New Guinea with quite a bit of variation in the number of body parts counted (Franklin and Franklin 1962; Smith 1988). The precise base number of the Edolo system is a bit difficult to establish but seems to have been thirty-four. At present, things are in the process of changing to a decimal system due to the influence of he decimal based national monetary system and the English language educational system. Body parts are still used but quantities are now stated in groups of tens and ones rather than using the full traditional numerology. A quantity like forty-three is usually expressed as nabũlasi biidia huniane ohodoa 'ten-total four ones three'. The word used for 'ones', huniane, may not be native Edolo vocabulary. The appearance of /n/ word-medially and the fact that huniane is not attested anywhere in the text database or the Mark text and my limited intuition suggest that it is a loan word although no source has been determined. Traditional counting starts with the little finger of the right hand and goes up the arm across the head and face and back down to the little finger of the left hand. The uncertainty regarding the base number arises from conflicting accounts as to which body parts between the shoulder and eye are counted. The confusion is probably due to the change to the decimal base such that the numbers above ten are seldom used now. Some informants have claimed that there is an old way and a new way with the new way using either galo 'side of neck' or giwi '(collar) bone' for twelve and ba 'cheek' or g?h? 'ear' for thirteen. The anthropologist Kelly, who did his fieldwork among the Edolo in the late 1960's, relates stories referring to pigs in groups of thirty-fo (1993:200). There would have been very little outside influence at that time indicating that the system was probably based on thirty-four originally. In the above table, I give the system including all of the seventeen body parts. The seventeen body parts are counted on each side of the body giving the base of thirty-four. In counting down the left side of the body in the traditional system the word nai is repeated before each of the numbers. Nai is apparently from naiado 'opposite'. In counting large quantities the counting is 'left off' when the little finger of the left hand is reached and it starts over again on the right side. One complete cycle is called fisi afãde 'leave-PAST one', or 'one leaving off'. The forms as they are used in counting are given in the first column of table. These are the same as the body part names, with the exception of mimogo 'seventeen', which is slightly different as given in the table. The same body part terms for one through seven are used of the foot and ankle when preceded by the word emo 'leg' but these are not used in counting."

This counting system involves both addition and multiplication of basic units by the power of base 10, that is, (10x + x). Àbà is derived from iba ‘two’ ata from ita ‘three’ and ánáñ from ínáñ ‘four’. The replacement of the initial vowels of these elements from /i/ - /a/ implies the doubling of the units which are then multiplied by 10 to achieve the derivation. From the numbers 41- 59, 61 – 79 and 81-99 involve the addition of the numbers 1-19 to the units of 40, 60 and 80 respectively. However, the derivation of 100 is somehow different from the above operation. . íkíé → kíét (1 x 10 x 10) ‘one hundred’ Íkíé ‘one hundred’ is clearly derived from kíét ‘one’. The phonological operation involves the deletion of the coda consonant in kiet and the insertion of the initial vowel in íkíé.

That is, it has a five-based unit of enumeration. Not all Panare speakers use exactly the same system but the variations encountered are all based on unites of five. The basic systems is built around body part term, most fundamentally the roots eña 'hand' and pata 'foot'. Numbers between multiples of five may involve expressions referring to digits of the footː yupun 'its head' or 'its point' (referring to the toes) or yïpoj 'its covering' (an alternative expression for the toes (When possessed by body parts other than 'hand' or 'foot', poj can refer to the hair of the head, hair of the eye or 'eyebrow' and hair of the chin. Its is also the root for 'clothing' as we;; as the classifier for apparel and necklaces.) The prefix na- has the effect of doubling the quantity otherwise indicated by whatever from na- is attached to. A possible translation of na- would be 'another'. For example, patáipun ( from pata y-ipu-n 'foot 3-point-POSS') forms the base for the numbers eleven through fourteen. Na-patáipun forms the bas for 'twenty', which marks the completion of counting 'another foot'. Na- possibly derives from pana. As a postposition on nouns pana means 'towards'. Pana occurs transparently in the number 'ten' where is denotes 'another completed hand'. (A less likely source for na- may be from eña 'hand'.) Na-toityo (cf. 'six', 'seven', 'nine') is possibly a reduced form of na-katoityo (cf. 'sixteen'), though for some speakers natoityo and nakatoityo mean different things. When toosen (variant tosen; or toose-jmën) 'big one' occurs in numerical expression, its effect is to multiply whatever precedes it by five. Thus, asaʔ patáipun toosen (literally, 'two foot.its.point big.one') translates as 'two one a foot (= all the digits of the hands plus two digits of a foot, or twelve) times five' or sixty'. Na-patá-ipun toosen 'another-foot-its.point big.one' means 'twenty times five' or 'one hundred'. This use of toosen derives from the colloquial Venezuelan Spanish expression (un) fuerte 'strong (one)' for a five Bolívar coin. The Panare calque is not surprising since a prime occasion for referring to quantities above twenty is when dealing with money, and prices in the rural economy are commonly quoted in fuertes. Even for numbers between, toosen is frequently used in monetary contextsː There is evidence of an earlier vigesimal (base-20) system. Above 100, the term eʔñapa 'person' enters into the numeral systems for referring to multiplies of either 'one hundred' or 'twenty'. For example, asaʔ enʔñapa (literally 'two people') does not means 'forty', but 'two hundred.' But some speakers use asaʔeʔñapa toosen for the meaning of 'two hundred', indicating that they take eʔñapa to mean 'twenty' (i.e., for them, adding toosen effectively multiplies the expression by 5, yielding ( 2 x 20) x 5 or 200). Also, the common expression for one thousand, panaa ñípun eʔñapa toosen, is consistent with eʔñapa meaning 'twenty', i.e., 'ten people ( 10 x 20), 'big ones' ( x 5) = 1000. If eʔñapa consistently referred to 100, this complex term would instead refer to 5,000. nevertheless, the word eʔñapa as meaning '20' has clearly been replaced in the lower numbers by the quintenary system based on the Venezuelan fuerte.

February 19, 2011.",,"Enggano has a numeral system very different from other Western Austronesian languages and now is regards as an 'Unclassified language' within the Austronesian Phylum but on 18th edition of 'Ethnologue' 2015, Enggano has been re-classified as 'Unclassified language', not conclusively established as an Austronesian language. Enggano has not been fully studied for several decades. A few sociolinguistic notes. Enggano is now spoken by about 700 people, all of whom are also fluent in Indonesian. But Enggano is still the language of the home for most. The numeral system, however, is rarely used since people have switched almost entirely to the more straightforward Indonesian numeral system, even when speaking Enggano. My language informants (both men and women, ages 30-40) were able to remember the Enggano forms 1-10 with ease, and with a bit of discussion found all of the forms through 20. But it took them a few days to discuss with older villagers and agree on the higher numeral forms (20-2000). I also questioned a group of 10-12 year old boys about numbers – they could only remember one, two, and three. Other notesː i. In diphthongs ending in a high vowel /i/ or /u/ before a glottal stop, the high vowel laxes to [ɪ] or [ʊ], respectively. So this kahaiʔ is pronounced kahaɪʔ in isolation. See also number 10. ii Literally, ‘five and two’. Phonetically the conjunction can either be he or hi; these two forms seem to be in free variation. iii Literally, ‘hugging’. Note that there are two inflected forms of this word which seem to be used interchangeably: kĩ-pa?ĩõp and ã-pãʔĩõp. The root is pã?ĩõp, which can exist independently as well as the imperative form of the verb ‘hug’. This might be a reference to the shape of the number 8, which could be seen as two objects hugging. This is my speculation and has not been confirmed by Enggano speakers. iv ka-ba kahai? literally, ‘one coming.’ This seems to mean ‘eight, and one more’. The full form seems to be kĩ?pã?ĩõp ka-ba kahai?. Perhaps the word for eight is not explicit here since it was just mentioned in sequence during the elicitation. See numbers 19 and 29, where the full form is attested. v kĩ?pã?ãũ? looks like another verb, since ki- and pa- are both prefixes and can occur in this order; as in the form ki-pa-pe ‘give’. I missed this connection while I was on the field, so I don’t know what the verb root (ãũ? ???) means. Phonetically, this word also undergoes high vowel laxing in a glide before a glottal stop. So phonetically the word is kĩ?pã?ãũ?. vi ratuh ‘hundred’ is borrowed from Malay ratus ‘hundred’, so kahai? ratuh is presumably the more recent form. dibu ‘thousand’ is borrowed from Malay ribu ‘thousand’. vii kĩ?pã?ãũ? he ãpã?ĩõp abai kaha? ‘ten and eight one coming’. Note that there are different inflections of the verbs on the various forms of 8 and 9, with the prefixes ki- and a- and the suffix –i. During this trip I did not have the opportunity to do research into Enggano morphology, so I do not know the significance of these different forms. I present them here as given to me during elicitation. viii kahai? kak literally ‘one person’. My informants told me that this is because a person has twenty digits – ten fingers and ten toes. Phonetically, the last part of the glide and the glottal stop metathesize, yielding the surface form kaha?ɪ kak. This is true for all the 20’s, 100, and 1000.

There is a lexeme do in compound numerals marks addition and it is roughly glossed as plus. The words for hundred dèri and thousand duɡu are probably borrowed from Hausa with phonological adaptations. As the traditional Etulo counting system appears to be cumbersome. In particular, the non-basic numerals are usually polymorphemic. In Addition, they are derived by series of addition and multiplication processes. The adoption of the decimal counting systems will make counting in Etulo to be less cumbersome. As the Etulo are bilinguals, they also speak Tiv and younger ones tend to use Tiv rather that Etulo. In order words, Etulo is endangered. Notesː 1. Low [v̀] and step [v̄] tones are fully marked, while high tone is unmarked. 2.

April 13, 2012.",,"The numeral system of contemporary Forest Enets is basically decimal although relicts point to a different system in the past. For example 'eight' šiđiät seems to be a fossilized compound of šiđi tät 'two four'. šiđu ‘twenty’ seems to be synchronically unsegmentable, too. Numerals do not show number morphology (no dual or plural) and apparently cannot be used with PX either. Numerals, too, take only some derivational morphology. A variety of observations concerning the phonetic representation of numerals could be made. First, the glottal stops with ‘three’ and ‘six’ are no longer audible. By adding the limitative -ru, assimilation to -lu occurs which shows that both numerals are underlyingly still glottal stop stems. Whether these numerals belong to class IIa or IIb could no longer be determined. Second, the phonetic shape of several numerals differs from speaker to speaker; instead of ŋol'u also ŋul'u ‘one’ and sobrig instead of sobirig ‘five’ occurs frequently. ANP pronounces motu(ʔ) generally as mutu and occasionally, instead of säu the historically older säʔu is infrequently attested. Also the glottal stop in biʔ 'ten’ is sometimes omitted and once a while biuʔ matching older accounts could be heard too. Numerals from 11-19 are morphologically complex and could be eventually interpreted as clauses. The last element bođad, a stative intransitive verb meaning ‘is more’ is apparently a defective stative verb which requires its first teen in the ablative, followed by a cardinal number. The numerals ‘eleven’ and ‘twelve’ translate as follows: bi-kuđ ŋol'u bođad ten-abl.sg one be.more.3sg ‘From ten one is more = 11’, from 10 1 is more bi-kuđ šiđi bođad ten-abl.sg two be.more.3sg ‘From ten two are more = 12’ In spontaneous speech, such clauses are often simplified: ŋol'u bođad one be.more.3sg ‘One is more = 11’ The numerals 13-19 are formed on the same principles. The numeral ‘twenty’ differs from the rest as it is not a compound of the highest power of ten followed by ten and cardinals which is the pattern for numerals from 30-99. Instead, an invariable šiđu ~ šiđuu ~ šiđiu ‘twenty’, which is then followed by cardinals, is used: Higher numbers from 30 to 99 are compounds whose second component is the numeral biʔ ‘ten’. d'uʔ meaning ‘hundred’ is used following then same pattern as for figures with ten. The glottal stop is often omitted: ďuʔ ~ ŋol'u ďuʔ 100 šiđi ďu 200 näxu ďu 300 The native Forest Enets system seems to end with 999. Whereas the numeral ‘thousand’ is known, there is considerable variation among the speakers. Speakers who were born in monolingual Forest Enets marriages use the Tundra Nenets lexeme for ‘thousand’ jonar ju.

Some numbers are currently being used interchangeably with currency values. They use the word [pámũ̀] `pound’ which is borrowed from pounds sterling. When pámũ̀ `pound’ is added to any number, the value of such number is multiplied by 2. For example, 10 is [pámũ̀ tá] (lit: five pounds). In addition to [pámũ̀] `pounds’, they also use [mṹṹtàlà] `twenty’ which is derived from the name of the former Nigeria head of state on twenty Naira note.

Basically Gadsup is a “20” point cycle system – partially like English 1 to 20. Afterwards English becomes consistent saying 20,30,40 etc. Gadsup though, keeps doing a “20” point cycle. They say “one man whole” for 20. Gadsup then takes their original “1-9” sayings and say them after “one man.” They say “one man + ten” (for 30). Gadsup then takes their original “11-19” sayings and say them after “one man.” This is repeated for “two man whole” (for 40) and “two man + ten” (for 50). 2. The term “man” (wa̱inta̱) represents “20” for all the 20 digits (fingers and toes) of man. The term “first time get” ( ma̱na yá̱cmá̱n) represents “5” for all the first 5 finger digits starting the counting cycle. The term “my two hands” (tiyǎnkanni/tiyǎnkarê) represents “10” for all the 10 finger digits starting the counting cycle. The term “one foot total” (ma̱na íká̱n tocyâmi) represents “5” for all the five toe digits of the first foot counted. To get the opposite hand or foot while counting notice the term “away to other side” (a̱fa̱c). 3. To ask a Gadsup person to show by actions what they are saying- he/she would say “one” and take one hand and bend and hold the little finger of the opposite hand. On saying 2, the second finger would also be held down, and so on until the thumb is clasped and the fist is shown for 5. The process is repeated by holding the toes one foot at a time for 11-20.

A high tonal accent of a head word , in a number composed of two words, moves towards the last syllable of a modifier, in case the modifier assigns its original high tonal accent either on its ante- penultimate, penultimate or ultimate mora. Due to this, the modifier assigns two high tonal accents whereas the head word loses its high tonal accent. The tonal accent on the ultimate mora of the modifier moves one syllable to the left in order to assign the high tonal accent that shifts from the head word. 2.3 Most of the numbers from 21 and above are composed of three words.

Except for the Garrwa words for one, two and three, all the others are flexible. Eg. 'murrgu' (small mob, or a few) covers most situations where a number exceeds three, but rarely more than five or six. 'Gaja' (big mob) covers situations beyond that but is used in a relative way depending on how many were expected. Except for the Garrwa words for one, two and three, all the others are flexible. Eg. 'murrgu' (small mob, or a few) covers most situations where a number exceeds three, but rarely more than five or six. 'Gaja' (big mob) covers situations beyond that but is used in a relative way depending on how many were expected. Here's an example: If you're talking about the fruit collected off bushes by two women, then half a coolamon (a shallow wooden dish with high sides) might be considered murrgu because the hungry people back at the camp expected more. If they brought back enough to feed everybody (two half-coolamons) then it would be gaja. If they brought back two full coolamons, it would be ga-a-a-ja (where the first vowel is stretched to indicate wonder and surprise, meaning biggest mob). But if you're talking about boomerangs, then the scale would be different. Hunting boomerangs are made from tree branches which might take forty years to grow. Careful selection and mistakes in manufacture means not many boomerangs are made every year. So a man who carries five boomerangs into camp might hear people say 'ga-a-a-ja ngubungu' (the biggest mob of boomerangs). I've filled out the third form, but it may help you to know that, except for the Garrwa words for one, two and three, all the others are flexible. Eg. 'murrgu' (small mob, or a few) covers most situations where a number exceeds three, but rarely more than five or six. The Garrwa alphabet is as follows: Three Vowels: a is always as in father i is mostly as in bin (only pronounced as in bet when it's shouted over a long distance) u is mostly as in foot, only sometimes as in fort Thirteen Consonants: (all sound like their English counterparts, except where noted) b, d, g as in girl, never 'j'. j as in Rudyard Kipling. It's not a hard 'j' alveolar sound, more a fronted alveolar, almost dental sound. l, m, n, ng as in singing. It's often used at the start of a word (very hard for English speakers to master). If the 'n' and 'g' sounds are said distinctly, they are separated by an apostrophe (eg. barn'ga for cousin). ny as in onion. r, rr as in a Scottish rolled 'r'. w, y."

The linkers 'ʃikà' and 'kà' can be used interchangeably. The word 'twenty' means ' catch a person', that is, counting all fingers and toes of a person adds up to 20.

The counting system to ten may also be accompanied by a system of equating by bending the fingers to the palm beginning with the little finger on hand, thence proceeding along that hand until the closed hand represents five. The closed hand then begins by holding down the little fingers of the other hands to the palm for six and then proceeds along the fingers of that hand until both hands are closed and held together for ten. There are two alternative systems from five to ten inclusive. One system uses the one-two basis solely and the other uses the one-two systems plus the hands. When the one-two system is used, it is most often accompanied by the equating system. The numeral phrases express the numerals eleven to twenty are based on the hands and feet of the speakers plus the one-two system. To cut down on redundancy the expression for 'ten' which precedes all these is left out. It should be noted that when one gets into the relatively high fingers above twenty, only round fingers are referred to. This basic system has influenced the assimilation of the Arabic numerals into the system. 60 'tuenti sutakobe', 80 'tuenti sui sui'. Because of the loquacious manner the language users in the counting systems, the Arabic systems is being adopted fairly rapidly. As a matter of interest you may like to know that in one situation where the people needed to know exact higher numbers in relation to their pig feast where the had to mark out their obligation to kill so many pigs in return to other clans they did it by laying out old pig jaws to see who would be killing how many."

The words ɡuɲɛn means ''hands'', ɡaat means ''foot'' and it is not clear whether the use of the item əvːi for 'king' and 'twenty' is a simple case of homonymy or is a metaphorically motivated. In the previous version I put a hyphen between prefixes and roots to distinguish them. Since this precision does not seem to be important for your presentation, I have taken it out. Borrowing: etemel ‘100’ could be a loan from Wolof (tɛːmɛːr cf. your section in Wolof) thus, coming from money counting. It could also be a common root since the languages are related i.e. they are all Atlantic. Historical evidence is required to give a definite answer to this. ekkeme ‘100’ is definitely a recent loan from Mandinka but through Jóola Fónyi following the Islamization of the Jóola Fonyi. The vast majority of native speakers, including myself, have been taught to say and do say etemel ‘100’. ekkeme ‘100’ is more often used by Muslims for whom Mandinka has a lot of prestige. How integrated it is in the language can be a matter of debate. fɷtɔx ‘five’ is not related to ‘to be sufficient’ which is ɛttɔx as argued in the Bandial data. The second root has a geminate consonant. So here we have a minimal pair between tɔx ‘five’ and ttɔx ‘to be sufficient’. For euli ‘1000’, I can see in your data that the root is shared with a couple of related languages. It could be a loanword from Mandinka/ Pulaar. But it could also be a shared root. Since the contact of the Eegimaa people with the latter was extremely restricted throughout History, nothing definite can be said unless historical linguistics analysis is carried out."

The basic Hahon data I recorded is the same as the data you sent me from G.A. Lean's book, except that I did not find [amba] for 'two' nor did I find [sabun] for 'ten'. [a'mbua] does occur before nouns which occur with the article /a/ in the singular e.g. /a bua ti/ 'the two men', since voiced stops are prenasalised after a vowel. I should also have pointed out that the /a/ here is an article. There is a noun class system in Hahon, and the basic diagnostic for class membership is to determine which of the articles /a/ /e/ or /o/ the singular noun can occur with. When the numbers ‘two’ and ‘three’ are used to modify nouns, we find that they have different forms depending on the class of the noun which they are modifying, as follows: /a ti/ ‘person (singular)’ /a bua ti/ ‘two people’ /o atova/ ‘sago tree (singular)’ /o boko atova/ ‘two sago trees’ /a vamioko/ ‘pawpaw fruit (singular)’ /kuka vamioko/ ‘three pawpaws’ /o vamioko/ ‘pawpaw tree (singular)’ /kukano vamioko/ ‘three pawpaw trees’ These variants also occur in the periphrastic numbers above five, but examples are not frequent: /o tsinivi/ ‘canoe (singular)’ /o taunima mono kukano tsinivi/ ‘eight canoes’ Note also that the conjunction here changes from /mana/ to /mono/.

This could be due to the fact that Mrs. Heikinnen was working in a community much further to the north, or the system she documented has since ""died out"".

Han speakers, however, were traditionally bilingual in Han and Gwich'in, which means that many Han speakers are under the impression that Han and Gwich'in are mutually intelligible.

It turns out on closer examination that jèchąh is a better spelling than jèchan(n). What does it mean?

Alternate names: Punan Bungan. Hobongan is situationed at the head of the Kapuas river in North eastern part of Kal-Bar, but actually a long ways from Sarawak and East Kal. The Hobongan has been spelled in the literature with a ""v"". This is not correct. After 35 years working with this language, I myself, my wife, my daughter and my son and his wife, and our 4 former partners are all agreed on this. We are all trained linguist.This is a ""b"" fricative in the particular environment of the word ""hobongan"". There are also hard ""b"" in other environments. Our daughter has done a linguistic write up on this and we could possibly get that to you. Generally word or utterance initial the b is a full stop, but in word or utterance medial the b changes to a fricative. The problem comes in our translation and literacy program. We have correctly written all hard and fricative voiced bi-labial's as a ""b"". The Indonesians without phonetic training are hearing a ""v"" so wrote it that way and it make it's way into the literature. The Hobongan themselves occasionally see it written as a ""v"" by what they consider educated people so and then cast doubt on what we have done. As I understand Penyabung was the name give by the Dutch, having to do with the attitude of the people (Bersabung - fighting cocks) Semukung is the name of the high caste within the Hobongan group. There are still people considered decedents of that caste. Uheng is the name of the Kapuas river in the Hobongan language. They always identify themselves by the name of the river they live on EX.

The system is based on ‘hand’ (uwɨxan) and ‘foot’ (nawɨn). The word amua refers to a complete hand or foot (with all five fingers). The word nuiʎaʃa is a connector meaning ‘besides’, in this context it could be translated as “plus”. There are no names for such numbers as those counting hundreds or thousands –at least none that I am aware of. Culturally, ipak usumak is more used for the number 9 and seems to be the patrimonial form. It makes reference to the finger used to paint (the index finger) (usumak is the root for ʼto paintʼ, ipak is the plant ""achiote"" lat. bixa orellana from what they extract a red color paint). There is alternate phrase for 9 ''aintuk aintuk uwɨhan amua iraku''.

Low tones may be overriden by sentence final intonation, which makes them sound like high tones, so basic tone contrasts have to be identified in non-final position. Syllables are long (two vowels, not rearticulated) or short (one vowel). Diphthongs and long vowels both fit a two-vowel rhythmic pattern.

September 4, 2013.",,"Igala has vigesimal numeral system. There are separate units for the numerals ‘zero’ to ‘ten’ in Igala. There are also other separate forms for higher units; óɡʷú for ‘twenty’, ódʒe for ‘fifty’, ɔ̀ɡbʷá ɔ́kɔ́ for ‘two hundred’ úlú (ɔ́kɔ́) for ‘four hundred’, óɡwúmétʃi for ‘seven hundred’, and the highest unit is ítʃámû ‘eight hundred’ in this hierarchy. The units for ‘two hundred’ and ‘four hundred’ may occur with an optional expression, ɔ́kɔ́‘money’. This may be a pointer to the fact that these units came into the numeral system with the invention of money in Igala economy at some. Other units in the numeral system are the morpheme òké ‘unit’, the overt addition morpheme, ɲú, the multiplication morpheme, mɔ́ and the subtraction morpheme, tʃì. For addition in the numeral system, the lower base numerals, particularly ‘one’ to ‘ten’, are used for counting the additions up to ‘nineteen’ in phrase combination with whatever is added. After these juxtapositions, there is the new unit, ógʷú for ‘twenty’. Observe above that there is a special form for ‘one’ in the combination meaning ‘eleven (ten plus one)’, using the alternate/clitic form, kâ instead of the fully-fledged ǒkâ morpheme. This alternate form also occurs everywhere else where the sum of addition brings the number to ‘plus one’ in the numeral system. Observe from the set of examples that beyond ‘twenty’, in the addition of ‘one’, a new morpheme, ɲú (lit. enter) ‘add’ is attached obligatorily before the added value. In counting ‘plus one’ in the thousandth, the morpheme, òké ‘unit’ makes ‘one’ an optional expression, as the sense of ‘unit’ may stand at this rate to also express ‘plus one’, as is shown in ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ̂ kâ) ‘one thousand and one’. The addition template, ɲú ((òké) mɔ́, is utilized generally in the higher numerals from ‘twenty’ in adding forms of the lower numerals generally. For numeral values lower than ‘thousand’; from ‘twenty’ upwards, even though the expression òké ‘unit’ may be utilized, it is phonologically optional as is shown using the brackets in the numeral examples. The simple additive morpheme, ɲú may also be used in isolation for addition. This is the case in instances such as ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ mɔ́ ɲú ódʒe (lit. two hundred add fifty), ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛ̀lú (lit. eight hundred add one hundred) ‘eight hundred’ and ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ (lit. eight hundred add two hundred) ‘one thousand’. Whereas in phrasal combinations for simple additions of the lower numerals, ‘eleven’ to ‘nineteen’, the structural means is generally by the juxtaposition of ‘ten’, the highest unit of the base numerals that can be paired with other units below it; juxtaposition for the purpose of addition in the higher numerals is restricted only to the two isolates in the system, óɡʷú ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty + ten) ‘thirty’ and úlú ɔ̀ɡʷá (four hundred + two hundred) ‘six hundred’. The hierarchy of occurrence is generally from a bigger number to a lower one without exception. Thus, the forms * ɔ̀ɡʷá úlú (two hundred + four hundred), * ɛ̀ɡʷá óɡʷú (ten + twenty) and maybe *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa (three + ten) are deviant structures for addition. ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷá ‘sixty’ however occurs, but as the sum shows, this case is rather for multiplication, and the ɛ̀ta form here is actually a shortened form for the underlying ɔ̀ɡbɔ̀ mɔ́ ɛta ɛ̀ɡʷá (twenty multiply three x ten) rather than simply *ɛ̀ta ɛ̀ɡʷa(three + ten), which is deviant. One other interesting fact of the Igala numeral system is revealed in the hierarchical organization of its metric system. It seems clear from the occurrence in the language of òké ‘unit’ between higher numerals and numerals between ‘one’ and ‘ninteen’ that numerals ‘one’ to ‘nineteen’ are considered mere units of the lower numerals to be added to higher numerals. This system would contrast with languages like English in which the units are ‘one’ through ‘nine’ only. Observe the following examples, 1001 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké (mɔ́ kâ) 1002 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ èdʒì 1010 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá 1019 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ɛ̀ɡʷá ɛ̀lá 1020 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ óɡʷú 1050 ítʃámû ɲú ɔ̀ɡʷá ɔ́kɔ́ ɲú òké mɔ́ ódʒe As the ungrammaticality of the treatment of ‘twenty’ and ‘fifty’ as units in ‘one thousand and twenty’ and ‘one thousand and thirty’ suggests, these are not lower units in Igala, even though nineteen in ‘one thousand and nineteen’ is demonstrated to be considered a unit. Thus for English it may be ‘units’, ‘tens’, ‘hundreds’, ‘thousands’, etc, for Igala it is ‘units’, ‘twenties’, ‘fifties’, ‘two hundreds’, ‘four hundreds’ and ‘eight hundreds’."

The vowels are pronounced as they are pronounced in Spanish. The ""e"" has the sound of ""e"" in ""better"". The ""a"" is central to the mouth. the ""u"" is front and rounded. The ""i"" is high and front, sounding like the two ""ee"" in ""beet"". There are only four vowels, with 16 consonants. The unusual consonant is ""sh"", which is like. The Ignaciano numbering system involves an suffix that defines the shape class of the item that is counted.

July 1, 2010.",,"The Ipili people have a very interesting traditional way of counting which includes pointing to various parts of their bodies as they say the numbers. When they say 1, they use their right hand to point to the little finger on their left hand. When they say 2, they point to the finger next to it, etc. When they say 6, they point to their wrist. When they say 7, they point to the middle of their lower arm. 'Yana' is the Ipili word for that part of their body, and 'sia' is a locative suffix, so 'yanasia' literally means 'at the lower arm.' When they say 8, they point to the place just above the elbow where they wear an armband which is called a 'kitupa.' When they say 9, the point to the middle of their upper arm. That Ipili number is made by adding the locative ending to the Ipili word for the upper arm, so it literally means 'at the upper arm.' When they say 10, they point to their shoulder and say the Ipili word for shoulder, plus the locative ending. When they say 11, they point to their neck and say the Ipili word for neck, plus the locative ending. When they say 12, they point to their left ear and say the Ipili word for ear, plus the locative ending. When they say 13, they point to their left eye and say the Ipili word for eye, plus the locative ending. When they say 14, they point to their nose and say the Ipili word for nose, plus the locative ending. When they say 15, they point to their right eye and say the word 'ambi' which means 'over there' before saying the alternate Ipili word for eye which adds the suffix 'ne.' When they say 16, they point to their right ear and say the word 'ambi' before saying the alternate Ipili word for ear which also adds the suffix 'ne.' When they 17, they point to their right shoulder and say the word 'napi' which means 'a little lower' before saying the Ipili word for shoulder with the suffix 'ne.' When they say 18, they point to the middle of their right upper arm and say 'napi' before saying the Ipili word for upper right arm with the suffix 'ne.' When 'paiyane' is not preceded by 'napi' it is the ordinal form of the number 18, by way of contrast with 'paiyasia' which is the cardinal form of the number 18. When they say the numbers 19 through 22, they point to the appropriate body part in the opposite order that they did while counting from 6 to 9, always using the ordinal form of the number preceded by 'napi.' When they say 23, they point to the thumb on their right hand and say 'napi' followed by 'yauwini' which literally means 'the fifth a little down below.' They continue on through the fingers on that hand until they get to the little finger. When they say 27, they point to that finger and say 'pondo.' When they say 28, they again point to the little finger on their left hand and say the Ipili word for 1 preceded by the word 'unya.' They then procede the same way they did from 1 onward the first time, but say the word 'unya' before each one. After paper money was introduced into the culture, they found it easier to use a number system based on 10 for larger numbers, so they used the Ipili cardinal number for 10 followed by the Ipili word for the number of 10s required to multiply to the desired number. They borrowed the words for 100 and 1,000 and added the Ipili word for number of each required to multiply to the desired number."

Mr. I-wen Lai, Student, Department of Linguistics, University of Texas at Austin, USA, eptember 9, 2008.",,"The above data was gathered in early 1960s. There were only two words for numbers with other few words for 'brothers', 'hands' and 'feet' for 3, 4, 5, 10, 15 and 20. When the researchers (Mr. & Mrs. Eastman) asked the native speakers to answer a question that might elicit some other numbers, such as ''how many egg are in the bowl?'', the answer would be ''I don't know'' or ''I don't know how to count'', ''count'' being a Spanish loan word. Numbers beyond one or two didn't seem to be used in many contexts. Recent data by Mr. I-wen Lai said that they uses Spanish numbers after five, ''cinco, seis, etc.''. The new data recorded by Lai was as followsː 1. núki:ka, 2. kúmi/kúːpɨ depending on the animacy. 3. sɨ:saramájɨːta:mi, 4. suwaramájɨːta:mi (suhuaramáj+taami/p+) animacy. For number 3 and 4, they actually literally means ""bad brother"" and ""good brother""! It has to do with their conceptualization of a pair being good and unpaired person being not good because he is lonely. This corresponds with how they count using their fingers! They pair up the fingers as they count: so the small finger pairs with the ring finger as they count 1 and 2, and the middle finger pairs with the index finger. So, the middle finger wouldn't be paired until the index finger is counted, which corresponds to the literal meanings of number 3 and 4 (bad brother and good brother). Of course, the use of number has been lexicalized so the native speakers were not able to tell us the original derivation of the number 3 and 4. It was after the lexical comparison and learning the local cultural value!"

Translated from Portuguese to English by Prof. Bernard Comrie.",,"Iranxe has a few words as for numerals: kỹtapy (one, alone, single), numã (two, some, few), pjatkipu (three, five), pjatkeky quatro (four), jepte'y muitos (many, much). -kipu has the meaning of tip, extremity, mimã-kipu /hand-tip/ 'finger', ti-kipu /rump-tip/ 'tail' pjat-kipu /? - tip/ 'three, five'. I can't identify the meaning of pjat, but I venture an explanation: The notion of “pair” (couple) is basic in the language. When speakers count on their fingers, they always do so grasping their fingers two by two. Thus, the quantifier for “three” or “five” would be 'something without a pair [unmatched]'. On the other hand, keky has the generic meaning of 'friend, companion' and thus pjat-keky (four) could mean ´friend, companion´, in other words 'something in a pair [matched]'. In everyday speech and even in stories, only kỹtapy, numã and jepte are generally used. Most are monolingual in Portuguese, and Irantxe speakers are over 50 years old. A splinter group, the Mỹky (Mynky, Münkü, Munku, Menku, Kenku, Myy), however, moved to escape assimilation, and were isolated until 1971.

For instance, i-hwjenhliʔ is ‘I am one/alone’, cf. si-hwanhliʔ ‘we are one/alone’, in-hwanhliʔ ‘you are one/alone’, etc. Some belong to an adjective-like class which shows, however, verbal prefixes for 1-2 person. -Notice the dialect name’s spelling is Iyojwa’ja or Iyojwa’aja.

Jarawara is mutually intelligible with Jamamadi and Banawá, so that the three can be considered dialects of a single language (Dixon 2004). The Jarawara words in what follows are orthographic, but where necessary I provide phonetic information. There are only really two numbers in Jarawara, ohari 'one' and fama [ɸama] 'two'. These are verbs, so the meanings are more precisely 'be one' and 'be two', respectively. Ohari also has a more general meaning, which is 'be alone/be the only one'. Examples with these can be found in the online Jarawara dictionary (Vogel 2006). There was a traditional way of expressing quantities beyond two that involved combinations of one and two and the word for 'hand' for five, but this system is hardly used nowadays. Mostly people use Portuguese numbers for anything above two. The Portuguese words are assimilated into Jarawara in two ways. For lower numbers, the Portuguese numbers become verbs in Jarawara, with the addition of the auxiliary na (many Jarawara verbs require this auxiliary). For higher numbers, the Portuguese numbers become adjectives in Jarawara. As for the traditional way of counting, the following sentence from a traditional story is an example of how it can be used."

I have converted Yumitani's notation for tones to the ones I used for consistency. The macron indicates a phonetic mid tone. Because the tone rules are not sufficiently understood, phonetic tones have been retained. 3. The ""barred i"" ɨ is a back unrounded vowel. 4. The ""t plus raised y"" tʸ is a voiceless unspirated palatal stop, IPA c. 5. The vowel / æ / is low front unrounded. The vowel / a / is low back rounded, roughly IPA ""turned script a"" ɒ. Note: I have converted Yumitani's ɑ to a in order to be able to mark tone. Consequently, despite the different orthographic practices, Kiowa low back /ɔ/ and Jemez low back /a/ are both phonetically and structurally equivalent. 6. The ""l"" following several numerals surfaces under certain morphophonological conditions. If a Jemez speaker were simply counting 1, 2, 3,..., the underlying / l / would not be pronounced. In Yumitani's data, some speakers use -š, the normal ""inverse number"" marker, after the numeral ""2"". None of our speakers did that. 7.

Tone Jirel has four contrastive tone patterns. The main domains of tone is the phonological word. This word may consist of one or more syllables or one or more morphemes. It is the realm of a correlation between pitch and contour. In the basic tone pattern, the characteristic pitch level is confined to the initial syllable of the word, while the contour spreads over the whole word. In monosyllabic words the contour is realized as a falling or non-falling glide. In di- and poly-syllabic words the non-falling contour is either level or rising. The other contour is falling. The contrastive tone patterns are marked with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 in superscript at the end of the word in the Roman transcription of Jirel. The two high tones carry numbers 1 and 3, the two low tones the numbers 2 and 4 respectively. Word-initial voiced stops and affricates / b /, / d /, / ḑ /, / j /, / g / occur only with low tone. All other consonants can occur with either high or low tone. Table 1.

August 7, 2013.",vigesimal,"Kaike has a traditional vigesimal system. It presents very interesting linguistic expressions in the derivation of higher numerals from the lower ones. It employs the mixtures of the arithmetic bases and other features such as addition and multiplication in the construction of higher numeral expressions. In this section, we discuss how they are organized semantically and integrated morphologically and syntactically into the grammar of Kaike. Morphological properties: The numerals in Kaike may be morphologically categorized into basic and derived. They are discussed as follows: (a) Basic numerals The basic numerals in Kaike include the linguistic expression of the numbers from 1 to 10, 40, 60, 80 and 100. The basic numerals do not undergo any morphological processes. Following are the examples: ti ‘one’ øhe ‘two’ sum ‘three’ li ‘four’ Na ‘five’ ru ‘six’ ne ‘seven’ ke: ‘eight’ ghu ‘nine’ cyu ‘ten’ Nethəl ‘forty’ pheraNe ‘fifty’ sumthəl ‘sixty’ lithəl ‘eighty’ Nathəl ‘hundred’ (b) Derived numerals Apart from the numerals exemplified, the rest are derived from different arithmetic bases by compounding and other morphological processes. The numerals 11-19 are derived from the base ‘10’ plus some other numeral. The numeral /cyudi / ‘eleven’, for instance, is formed by adding /ti/ ‘one’ to the base /cyu/ ‘ten’. This is simply the compounding process. Following are the examples. /cyu-di / [cyu-ti ] ‘eleven’ /cyo-Ne/ [cyo-Nhe] ‘twelve’ /cyu-sum/ [cyu-sum] ‘thirteen’ /cyu-lli/ [cyu-li] ‘fourteen’ /cyor-Na/ [cyu-Na] ‘fifteen’ /cyu-ru/ [cyu-ru] ‘sixteen’ /cyo-nne/ [cyu-ne] ‘seventeen’ /cyor-ge/ [cyu-ke:] ‘eighteen’ /cyur-gu/ [cyu-ghu] ‘nineteen’ However, there occur a number of morphophonological processes in the derivation of higher numerals assuming the lower numeral as the base. In example, the voiceless alveolar stop /t/ has been changed into voiced alveolar stop in intervocalic position. In example, the aspiration of velar nasal /ŋh/ is deleted in compounding. Insertion of /r/ occurs in (e, h and i). In Kaike, the numerals ‘twenty’ and ‘thirty’ are formed by multiplying the base ‘10’ by two and three, respectively. Following are the examples. /øicyu/ [øi-cyu] ‘twenty’ /suncu/ [sum-cyu] ‘thirty’ In above example, not only bilabial nasal /m/ changes into alveolar nasal /n/, but the segment /y/ from /cyu/ is also deleted. In Kaike, the derivation of the higher numerals ‘forty’, ‘sixty’, ‘eighty’, and ‘hundred’ may be assumed with the base /thəl/. However, Kaike does not any independent value for this ‘base’. There is already an independent compound expression for ‘twenty’ in Kaike. If we may simply posit the value of this base as ‘twenty’, we can derive forty, sixty, eighty, and hundred by multiplying the base by two, three, four and five, respectively. Following are the examples. /øethəl/ [Ne-thəl] ‘forty’ /sumthəl/ [sum-thəl] ‘sixty’ /lithəl/ [li-thəl] ‘eighty’ /Nathəl/ [Nathəl] ‘hundred’ In Kaike, the numeral expressions for the numbers, 21-29, are constructed according to the pattern ... xn + y, i.e. some numeral x (i.e. 2) multiplied by the base (i.e. 10) and (plus) some other numeral (Comrie, 2008). Following are the examples: /øicureti/ [øhe-cyu-re-ti] ‘twenty-one’ /øicureNe/ [øhe-cyu-re-Nhe] ‘twenty-two’ /øicuresum/ [øhe-cyu-re-sum] ‘twenty-three’ /øicureli/ [øhe-cyu-re-li] ‘twenty-four’ /øicureNa/ [øhe-cyu-re-Na] ‘twenty-five’ /øicureru/ [øhe-cyu-re-ru] ‘twenty-six’ /øicurene/ [øhe-cyu-re-ne] ‘twenty-seven’ /øicureke/ [øhe-cyu-re-ke] ‘twenty-eight’ /øicureghu/ [øhe-cyu-re-ghu] ‘twenty-nine’ As in Mandarin, Kaike also follows the decimal system in the derivation of the numerals 21-29. The general structure of numerals in a decimal system is x10 + y. In Kaike, as in Diola-Fogny (Atlantic, Niger-Congo; Senegal) the numerals in (26a) may be expressed as ‘two tens and one’. However, the numeral expressions for the numbers, 31-39, are constructed according to the pattern ... xn+n+y, i.e. some numeral x (i.e. 2) multiplied by the base (i.e. 10) plus the base (i.e.10) plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: /øicurecyudi / [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ti] ‘thirty-one’ /øicurecyoNe/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-Ne] ‘thirty-two’ /øicurecisum/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-sum] ‘thirty-three’ /øicurecyurNa/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-Na] ‘thirty-five’ /øicurecyuru/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ru] ‘thirty-six’ /øicurecyone/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ne] ‘thirty-seven’ /øicurecyorke/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ke] ‘thirty-eight’ /øicurecyurgu/ [øhe-cyu-re-cyu-ghu] ‘thirty-nine’ In Kaike, the above numerals may be expressed as ‘two tens and tens one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 41-49, are constructed according to the pattern n and y, i.e., the base (i.e. 40) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: /Nethəlreti/ [Nethəl-re-ti] ‘forty-one’ /NethəlreNe/ [Nethəl-re-Ne] ‘forty-two’ /Nethəlresum/ [Nethəl-re-sum ‘forty-three’ /Nethəlreli/ [Nethəl-re-li] ‘forty-four’ /NethəlreNa/ [Nethəl-re-Na] ‘forty-five’ /Nethəlreru/ [Nethəl-re-ru] ‘forty-six’ /Nethəlrene/ [Nethəl-re-ne] ‘forty-seven’ /Nethəlreke/ [Nethəl-re-ke] ‘forty-eight’ /Nethəlregu/ [Nethəl-re-ghu] ‘forty-nine’ In Kaike, the numerals in above table may be expressed as ‘forties and one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 51-59, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 40) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: Nethəlrecudi [Nethəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘fifty-one’ NethəlrecyoNe [Nethəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘fifty-two’ Nethəlrecyusum [Nethəl-re-cyu-sum ‘fifty-three’ Nethəlreli [Nethəl-re-cyu-li] ‘fifty-four’ NethəlrecyorNa [Nethəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘fifty-five’ Nethəlrecyuru [Nethəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘fifty-six’ Nethəlrecyone [Nethəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘fifty-seven’ Nethəlreke [Nethəl-re-cyu-ke:] ‘fifty-eight’ Nethəlregu [Nethəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘fifty-nine’ In Kaike, the numerals in (29a) may be expressed as ‘forties and tens one’. The numeral expressions for the numbers, 61-69, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 40) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: sumthəlreti [sumthəl-re-ti] ‘sixty-one’ sumthəlreNe [sumthəl-re-Ne] ‘sixty-two’ sumthəlresum [sumthəl-re-sum] ‘sixty-three’ sumthəlreli [sumthəl-re-li] ‘sixty-four’ sumthəlreNa [sumthəl-re-Na] ‘sixty-five’ sumthəlreru [sumthəl-re-ru] ‘sixty-six’ sumthəlrene [sumthəl-re-ne] ‘sixty-seven’ sumthəlreke [sumthəl-re-ke] ‘sixty-eight’ sumthəlregu [sumthəl-re-ghu] ‘sixty-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 71-79, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 60) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: sumthəlrecyudi [sumthəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘seventy-one’ sumthəlrecyoNe [sumthəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘seventy-two’ sumthəlrecyosum [sumthəl-re-cyu-sum] ‘seventy-three’ sumthəlrecyoli [sumthəl-re-cyu-li] ‘seventy-four’ sumthəlrecyorNa [sumthəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘seventy-five’ sumthəlrecyuru [sumthəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘seventy-six’ sumthəlrecyone [sumthəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘seventy-seven’ sumthəlrecyorke [sumthəl-re-cyu-ke] ‘seventy-eight’ sumthəlrecyurgu [sumthəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘seventy-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 81-89, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 80) and some other numeral. Following are the examples: lithəlreti [lithəl-re-ti] ‘eighty-one’ lithəlreNe [lithəl-re-Ne] ‘eighty-two’ lithəlresum [lithəl-re-sum] ‘eighty-three’ lithəlreli [lithəl-re-li] ‘eighty-four’ lithəlreNa [lithəl-re-Na] ‘eighty-five’ lithəlreru [lithəl-re-ru] ‘eighty-six’ lithəlrene [lithəl-re-ne] ‘eighty-seven’ lithəlreke [lithəl-re-ke] ‘eighty-eight’ lithəlregu [lithəl-re-ghu] ‘eighty-nine’ The numeral expressions for the numbers, 91-99, are constructed according to the pattern taking the base (i.e. 80) and ten plus some other numeral. Following are the examples: lithəlrecyudi [lithəl-re-cyu-ti] ‘ninety-one’ lithəlrecyoNe [lithəl-re-cyu-Ne] ‘ninety-two’ lithəlrecyusum [lithəl-re-cyu-sum] ‘ninety-three’ lithəlrecili [lithəl-re-cyu-li] ‘ninety-four’ lithəlrecyarNa [lithəl-re-cyu-Na] ‘ninety-five’ lithəlrecyaru [lithəl-re-cyu-ru] ‘ninety-six’ lithəlrecyone [lithəl-re-cyu-ne] ‘ninety-seven’ lithəlrecyorke [lithəl-re-cyu-ke] ‘ninety-eight’ lithəlrecyurgu [lithəl-re-cyu-ghu] ‘ninety-nine’ The numerals higher than hundred also follow the compounding system in Kaike. However, in such numerals /kyma/ refers to one hundred. The numeral ‘two hundred ’, for instance, is expressed as hundreds two. However, the numeral ‘two hundred fifty’ is expressed as hundreds two plus fifty. Following are the examples: /kyamapheraNNe/ [kyama-pheraNNe] ‘one hundred fifty’ /kyamaNe/ [kyama-Ne] ‘two hundred’ /kyamaNpheraN/ [kyama-N-pheraN] ‘two hundred fifty’ /kyamasum/ [kyama-sum] ‘three hundred’ /kyamali/ [kyama-li] ‘four hundred’ /kyamaNa/ [kyama-Na] ‘five hundred’ /kyamaru/ [kyama-ru] ‘six hundred’ /kyamane/ [kyama-ne] ‘seven hundred’ /kyamake/ [kyama-ke] ‘eight hundred’ /kyamagu/ [kyama-gu] ‘nine hundred’ [1] Givón (2001:100) does not put ordinals (i.e., ‘first’, ‘second’, ‘third’) within the numerals (i.e., ‘one’, ‘two’, and ‘three’). [2] However, there is a word /thil/ ‘palm’, a body part, in Kaike. Thus, we may surmise that /thəl/ refers to such body part having twenty counting units in total."

The U. grads are usually very jealous for their language and argue with those who claim that it is just another form of Guarani. Note on the orthographic spellings and translations: In this material the 'e' is open as in the word pen in English. The 'y' is a mid, central, unrounded vowel. When a word has a nasalized vowel, all preceding vowels in the word are nasal until there is a non-nasal consonant. thus, the 1st e in peteĩ is oral, but all vowels in 'mokõi' are nasal.

This system is seldom used for counting numbers greater than six. (ii) a body-part system which uses the hands, arms shoulders and chest. One complete round of the body is 23. This method is used for tallying and specifying numbers greater than five or six. The counter starts with the little finger of one hand (it doesn't matter which hand), ring finger is 2, middle finger is 3, index finger is 4, thumb (usually shown with the fist clenched) is 5, wrist 6, forearm 7, inside of elbow 8, bicep 9, outside of shoulder 10, midpoint between shoulder and neck is 11, base of neck is 12.

After 12 the speaker adds the word ps (half, side) is added to each body-part name to indicate he is counting the other side of the body. After competing the first round the counter continues by going in the reverse direction but he begins with the second finger, so each round after the first is 22.

The phonetic transcription within square brackets [ ] represent the actual pronunciation (segments within parenthesis are clearly reduced in utterance-final position), whereas the transcription within angled brackets // represent my tentative phonemic analysis (in uncertain cases alternative phonemic forms are displayed). At the moment of submitting the data, I have analysed Kalkoti as having six contrasting vowel positions, with a length contrast for at least four of those positions: /ii, i, ee, e, ææ, aa, o, oo, u, uu/. I admit that this analysis may have to be revised after more careful investigation has been carried out. The language also makes use of significant tonal contrasts, tentatively with the following tonal patterns possible in a prosodic word: 0 (no underlying tone), L (low tone), H (high tone), and LH (low-to-high rising). Tonal marking, however, has not been applied here, due to lack of enough context to facilitate a more precise analysis in this regard. For details, see ( Liljegren 2009; 2013) The system is essentially vigesimal and the numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 20 are non-analysable. The numerals 11, 13-18 are formed by n+10, typically with phonetic reduction of the initial segment(s) of the numeral 10. The numerals 21-30 are formed by n+(conj)+20. Forty (40) is two twenty. Fifty (50) is built up in the following way: 10+(conj)+two-twenty. The elements /soo/ ‘hundred’ and /zir/ ‘thousand’ are Pashto loans. References: Liljegren, Henrik. 2009.

When the numeral word ends in a vowel, the initial vowel of the pro-verb is deleted. In theory, they can continue counting above 35 by starting again on the left hand with the phrase ‘fudo: imilise a:la:ta:ga: imilise’ ‘one “thirty-five” and one’. However, while in theory (and possibly in past usage) this system can be used ad infinitum, in current practice they rarely count specific items above 20 using this traditional method of counting. Rather, they use the English system of base 10, still using Kaluli terms. In this system they count the number of ‘tens’ by using a phrase such as ‘three tens and three’ for the number 33. However, for numbers over 100, they tend to use the term fudo: to mean one-hundred. At the present time with both systems in usage concurrently, this double usage of the term fudo: causes significant confusion when it is used, since some understand it to indicate 100 items, whereas others are thinking of it in terms of 35 items.

It consists of the stem tor- ‘10’ plus the building morpheme for tens, -duma, and could thus literally be translated as ''ten-ty''. As shown in the above table, the subsequent tens ('20', '30', …, '90') are formed through multiplication. The numbers from 2 to 9 serve as multipliers, -duma as multiplicand. A long vowel is located between multiplier and multiplicand. This vowel is mostly -aa (see, for instance, ont-aa-dúma '50'), in one case -oo (see lam-oo-dúma '20') The lexeme sadʒdʒ-aa-dúma ‘30’ is slightly irregular: it contains dʒdʒ as a second stem consonant while the basic numeral sás-o ‘3’ has a stem-final s. Note that the numeral tor-dúma ‘10’ contains an element tor-, the numerals from 11 to 19 are based on another allomorph of ‘10’, namely too-. Whereas the long vowel between the multiplier ‘two’ and the multiplicand ‘ten’ is -oo in lamoo-dúma '20', it is ee for the numbers between 21 and 29; see, for instance, lam-ée-na hezzéetto ‘28’. All other numbers consisting of tens plus units are generated in a regular way and the long vowel of the tens is retained in the tens plus units; see, for instance, sadʒdʒ-aa-dúma ‘30’ and sadʒdʒ-áa-na ónto ‘35’. The numbers t’ibbíta ‘100’ and kumíta ‘1000’ are not case and gender-agreeing numeral attributes but feminine nouns. With the younger generation, kumíta is being replaced by the Amharic loan ʃii '1000'. The numeral milooná ‘one million’, a masculine noun, is borrowed from European languages via Amharic. As modifiers of a head noun, the numeral nouns are always encoded in the genitive case. Source: Treis, Yvonne 2007. Cardinal numerals in Kambaata. In: Machalík, Tomáš and Jan Záhořík (eds.).

Kam (glottocode: kamm1249) is a language spoken in some 27 villages, in Bali Local Government Area, Taraba State, Nigeria. The biggest Kam village is Mayo Kam. My estimate (based on interviews with 16 village heads) is that there are currently (May 2017) somewhere between 20,000 and 25,000 Kam speakers. The name Kam is an exonym of unknown origin. Speakers call themselves and their language Nyiwom (pronounced [ɲĩ́ w̃ɔ̃̀m], and in English spelled as Nyingwom), meaning 'Kam people'. The language is still very much alive, especially in the more remote villages, but most aspects of traditional culture, (including, for example, traditional stories), are now rarely performed and are no longer transferred to future generations. Since Greenberg (1963), Kam has been classified as an Adamawa language, but its relationship with the Adamawa group and other surrounding languages has not been studied in detail and requires much more scrutiny.

I have been told that some older speakers in the reservation can provide Karitiân numbers for 21-29, but I have been unable to verify this.

The numbers for 10-20 are also commonly known, though I have been given some discrepant responses for a few of these numbers. The ones I provide have been given on multiple occasions. They differ somewhat from those in Landin’s lexicon (he provides 10-12, 15-18, and 20 only). The numbers for 30-90 have not previously been documented in the literature on Karitiân, and were corroborated with 3 adults. As far as the general patterns in the number system, here are some observations: Karitiân is a quinary-based system. The word for ‘hand’ is p?. ?j is a 1st person plural prefix. So many of the numbers clearly include the morphemes corresponding to “our hand”. pi means foot, while piopɨ̃ refers to ‘toe’ and pɨopɨ̃ to ‘finger.’ ota and /oːt are the words for ‘another/other’ and ‘meanwhile,’ respectively.

The Keiese language has no official orthography of its own, and there are phonetic and lexical differences in this language from one village to another (please glance through the survey write-up attached). The data given above are based on the “dialects” spoken mostly in the southern part of the Lesser Kei Island, which I believe are close to the earliest version of this language. 2. In my opinion, there is no long vowel in Keiese (some Keiese speakers may not agree). [faak] is actually composed of two syllables, i.e. [fa] and [ak]. Some speakers in Lesser Kei might pronounce this word as [fa:ak] just to emphasize the first [a], but that [a] is not a long vowel. [faak] has a variant of [fak], and both are commonly used. The root of [faak] and [fak] is [faka-]; in some villages, the last [a] of [faka-] is dropped and so it is pronounced as [fak], and in others, the [ka] is changed to [ak] (i.e. metathesis) and so it is pronounced as [faak] (both ‘aa’ are stressed, and that is why sometimes it might sound like a long vowel; however, the second ‘a’ might receive slightly more stress in most villages). 3. As I said in my first reply to your email, numerals like ‘ensa’ and ‘enru’ are colloquial versions of ‘ain sa’ and ‘ain ru’ respectively. I believe that most native speakers do not even know that that ‘en’ is the short form of ‘ain.’ I gave you both versions in the table. You may choose to show both in your data if that will not confuse your readers. For formal writing (but well, they don’t even have an official orthography), I would recommend ‘ain’ instead of ‘en.’ [ən] is never stressed (and is often written by native speakers as a proclitic to the following numeral), and so in words like [ənsiᵘ], the stress obviously falls on the diphthong. 4. [aᵘ] and [iᵘ] are diphthongs. In some villages in Greater Kei, the [ᵘ] has been dropped, and so [wa] is for the numeral ‘eight’ and [si] for ‘nine.’ 5. The phoneme /β/ has an allophone of [v] (identical to the English phoneme /v/) which can be heard mostly in Lesser Kei. In my proposed orthography for the language, both /β/ and [v] are represented by the letter ''v''."

Composites and reduplication – 4, 5 areː 'Four' is expressed by combining aere 'two' with the specific article ato 'a, one' and reduplicating this, as in: aerato aerato [a two a two]. 'Five' is a composite consisting of aerato reduplicated and combined with aterei ato. 'a one' [aterei 'one' combined with ato 'a']: aerato aerato aterei ato [a two a two a one]. Body part tallying system – groups of five. For larger quantities Koromu speakers use actions involving the body. This nonverbal communication can be described verbally in several different ways: Speakers can indicate a quantity using actions with body parts. They can describe this with the terms for body parts and verbs which describe the actions. The body parts are: wapi ahane 'thumb/fist' (lit. the hand’s mother) wapi 'hands' and ehi 'legs' '5' is expressed by clasping wapi ahane hand mother-P3s 'fist' (lit. mother of the hand. Also used for the thumb. In counting it refers to the fist with the thumb at the top.) '10' is expressed by bunching two wapi ahane [hand mother] 'fists' together. [Note that there is no plural marker on nouns in Koromu.] '15' is expressed by clasping the two wapi 'hands' together on one knee ehi toko (lit. leg bone/joint). [Wapi 'hand' without ahane 'mother' is sufficient here.] '20' is expressed by clasping the wapi 'hands' and ehi legs together. Actions using wapi 'hand' and ehi 'leg' can also be described with possessives. '10' can be indicated by io wapi aere 1sGEN hand two 'my two hands', '20' can be indicated by io wapi ore ehi ore 1sGEN hand with leg with 'my hands and legs (lit. my hands with legs)', '30' can be indicated by io wapi ore ehi ore no wapi aere my hand with leg with your hand two 'my hands with my legs with your two hands', '40' can be indicated by io wapi ore io ehi ore …. my hand with my leg with no wapi ore no ehi ore your hand with your leg with 'my hands and my legs … with your hands and your legs …' (For more details on clausal structures see Priestley forthcoming. Large amounts in Papua New Guinea’s currency, such as 100, 500 and 1000 kina, can be expressed by reference to a particular cultural artifact in different sizes. Since these expressions are used when speakers do not want other people to understand the amounts they are discussing I am not putting them in print at this time. Koromu exponents of the semantic primes for quantity: werai 'a few/ a little', asao/asa/atsao 'some', nupu 'much, many', nupu 'all' werai reduced to rai means 'very few' nupu reduplicated as nupu nupu means 'very many' ‘Very many’ can also be expressed by lengthening the first vowel, as in nuupu Groups. The enclitic =ama is used to indicate ‘group of’. A whole group of women can be expressed by pisi as a modifier of hena 'women'. Referencesː Priestley, Carol. 2009.

Mr. Ron Kriens. Wycliffe International, Indonesia. August 11, 2009.",,"Ketengban use a system of counting that starts on the small finger of the left hand and works its way up the hand counting each finger/ digit, and folding it down as one goes along. You touch each point along the way, or point to it on your left side with your right forefinger. This renders the first 5 numerals. Then one continues the count in the same manner (pointing the right finger to each spot) by moving up along the arm at various points: first the wrist: ngantanbari (= 6), the forearm: yonitambari (=7), inner elbow/ crook of arm: banbari (= 8 ), bicep : topnebari (=9), shoulder : morokyo ... or ... dongolbari (=10 ), side of neck: kumdam (=11), ear: amol (=12), temple: amol deiki (=13 ), and finally bridge of the nose: ue ... or ... uwe.... or .... ue deiki (=14). One may put two closed fists together to make a 10 count (two fives) and say ""ukuprap"" which means: ""This many like this"". One may also put one's feet together for an additional 10 count or a total of 20 and say ""ukuprap""=""This many like this"". Otherwise the feet or the individual foot digits are not used in counting. However, by doing this: holding two closed fists out, and putting the two feet together, one may indicate a count of 20. One may indicate a count of 28 by saying "" from the top of the nose and down both sides="" ue deiki dan-dana tara yuma"". That=(14 times 2 or 28 total). A very common set of expressions is to name the topmost point in the upward count and say: ""that one and down from there"" which means the total count from that point downwards. So for example to say 'from near the neck and all/everything down from there' : ""kum dam di du tamna yuma"" is to say 12. Similarly, to say 'from the shoulder and all/everything down from there': ""morokyo di du tamna yuma"" is to say 10. It is very uncommon for people to try to count beyond 14 or beyond 28. The use of national language numbers (Indonesian) has become quite common for numbers larger than 20."

October 19, 2011, March 22, 2012.",,"The above data is taken from Standard Khasi. miː//ʃi (or wiː// ʧi) represents a contrastive pair. In English, 'one' has different mathematical uses which are disambiguised in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam with *mi and *ʧi. mi is mainly used as cardinal one, ʃi/ʧi is mainly used to count ‘one’ for measure units and to count ‘one’ for powers of ten. For example, in War ʃi phuːa ‘ten’, lit. ‘one-ten’, ʃi swaɁ ‘one hundred’. mi expresses cardinal ‘one’ in ‘one leave’; ʃi swaɁ mi ‘one hundred one’. ʃi/ʧi expresses one in measure units: ʃi khup ‘one breadth-of-four fingers’. ʃi/ʧi is also used as ‘one’ for units of time, e.g. the whole day, one month length. mi ‘one’ to express ‘one o’clock’ contrasts with ʃi to express ‘one hour’ as a unit of time. ʃi/ʧi may also be used for a unit whose cardinal value is not relevant or is undefined as in War ʃi dit ‘a little while’, ʃi kur ‘people from the same clan’, ʃi pero brothers and sisters from the same mother. This is a qualifying use v.s. quantifying use of previous examples. ʃi/ʧi is also used as a kind of aspectual device, as in War: ʃi pam ‘to cut in one blow’ (pam ‘to cut’). Pnar, Khasi and Lyngngam cardinals belong to a Pnaric system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. Numerals expressing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 have common roots but 7, 8, 9 and teens are different. In Pnar the loss of /m/ or /b/ in onset position of monosyllabic words is frequent, as in mi > wi (one), ba > wa (dependency marker). This loss is not found in lexical elements in Khasi and Lyngngam. The Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are then derived from the Pnar one.

October 19, 2011, March 22, 2012.",,"The above data is taken from Langkymma Lyngngam dialect in West Khasi Hills. Lyngngam cardinals belong to a late Pnaric cardinal system which slightly differs from a War one, more conservative from an AA viewpoint. The Pnaric and War composite cardinal systems are analysed in details in the light of very conservative Pnaric-War-Lyngngam (PWL) Austro-Asiatic ''groupings'' systems in Daladier (to appear) '' Grouping is used in the sense of Menninger (1969). The names of these PWL groups are found again with shifts in their cardinal values all over AA languages'' Groupings in this PWL counting system use combinations of groupings in base four, five and twenty. Vestiges of such numeration bases are found in Munda cardinals (see Zide 1978) and in TB cardinals (see Matisoff 1997 and Mazaudon 2010). Vestiges of numeration in base four and five are found in some MK cardinal systems, see Jenner (1976) and MPI (2010). In addition to the Pnar and War cardinal systems, where Khasi and Lyngngam cardinal systems are inherited from the Pnar one, two main pairs of number classifiers for humans and non humans are used in Pnaric-War-Lyngngam: a pnaric one and a War one. Interestingly Lyngngam seems to have remains of a South Munda one with opposite values. In Pnar and in Khasi ŋut is used for people, təlli for goods and ʤur for pairs of animals. In War -be, -baj is suffixed as a number classifier for people and khlɔn for whatever is not human. They add the idea of being a pair or a triad etc. for the counted elements, which usually denote in context a set of exactly two, or three etc. elements; for example in War: Ɂũr.be ˀi hun ‘a set of two children, both children’, laj.be ˀi hun ‘the three (of them) children’; Ɂũ khlɔn ˀi kwoj ‘a couple of betel nuts’. In Langkymma Lyngngam, cardinals are suffixed with -re and -de classifiers for non humans from ‘two’ to ‘nine’ as follows: -re for ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’, ‘six’, (‘seven’), ‘eight’, ‘nine’ and -də for ‘five’. After ‘nine’, Lyngngam uses Pnar classifiers. Pnaric ŋut is used as a classifier for people and təlləj, from pnaric təlli, is used as a classifier for non humans after nine. Zide (1978:57) shows that in GtaɁ (South Munda), -re and -de are suffixed to cardinals to count people (as opposed to cattle and goods) in the following way: -re/-rwa is added to cardinals three, four, seven, eight, nine, ten and -de/-da to cardinals five and six. The similarity of the use of -de and -re in Lyngngam and in GtaɁ suggests in addition to many other data, a previous common quinary grouping number system. Lyngngam has more common lexical elements with Munda than Pnar, War and Khasi. There is a switch in Lyngngam in the value of number classifiers -re, -de used to count non humans while -re is used in AA to count humans. *raː is a classifier for people in West Bahnaric languages, see Jacq and Sidwell (2000). -r is still used in Munda and in PWL to denote inhabitants of places as in War ‘people of the rivers’.

Something like Fayu, which has ‘one, two, three’; there is no word ‘four’, but then there is ‘five’. I assume that the latter just means ‘a full hand’, or something like that, but I have never heard the Kirikiri use that. If they need to express that amount, they can show their fingers, and say “like this”. I have never heard them use any native word for ‘five’. Tone: We have 7 word tone patterns, two of which I have analyzed as being LHL, but different kind. The other one is phonetically something like LML in isolation, but in a context it is not so clear. I have not been able to elicit the word for ‘two’ in isolation, as it would be a very unnatural thing to say. So my tone assignment for it is still uncertain, just an assumption based on how it seems to behave in longer contexts. I have only marked where the High tone falls on the word for ‘one’. If the tone for ‘two’ is what I suspect at the moment, the slightly higher pitch would be on the second syllable, followed by a slight fall to the starting pitch. I don’t know what kind of marking system you would use. They have indeed borrowed Indonesian numbers now with many possible variations."

For those Kisi who accept the use of Nyakyusa numerals, counting beyond ten involves counting multiples of tens for decades and adding single digit numerals to this number. Thus, twenty‑five is counted as two tens and five. Swahili numerals are used for the multiples of hundreds and thousands. In counting, class 9 ennumerative agreement is used for ‘one’ and class 10 agreement for ‘two’ through ‘five’. The numeral lilongo ‘ten’ is a class 5/6 noun and so multiples of ten take class 6 agreement. Lilongo appears to be used regularly by the Kisi, but is considered to be Nyakyusa in origin so some Kisi prefer to use Swahili numerals for multiples of ten. Note that Kisi is not a tonal language, rather it is purely a stress language like Nyakyusa. jh in the orthography stands for [ʝ] but this can be pronounced [dʒ] but some, and a very few Kisi will accept [j] as a pronunciation. bh is [β], gh is [ɣ] and lilongo is [liloᵑɡo] though not all Kisi accept the use of lilongo as it is a Nyakyusa loan. They themselves do not seem to have numerals larger than five anymore so people will either use Swahili for everything beyond 5 or Nyakyusa lilongo mixed with Kisi smaller numerals to count multiples of ten. Either way, Swahili is used for numerals 6-9. For 80. themanini, as it is a Swahili loan it isn’t native to either language so it would be pronounced as [θ] following Swahili."

An anthropologist called Nicholas Allen did work on Thulung in the early 70's, and he too recorded an almost complete loss of the numeral system. As for tones, Allen had found traces of tone in Thulung (it took him years to notice it, and it wasn't consistently applied by all speakers--also, he found that the great majority of the words in the language did not have tone), but I found that any tones there may have been were lost by the time I got there. Tone loss through contact is a documented pattern, and as Nepali has no tone, I think that younger speakers must have decided over time that any differences they heard in the few words older speakers made tone distinctions for were irrelevant... Anyway, I feel confident in saying no tone in current-day Thulung. As for Koyi, there are no earlier records, so who knows, but I didn't see evidence of tone when I was there. I’ve only given you the numerals I elicited, but the patterns seem pretty clear and productive: numerals above 10 simply list the different components making them up, and sɔ appears to be 0. 100 had two variants, as listed (both elicited). 20 also has variants: one, sɔksɔ, I elicited, whereas the other, sɔpusɔ, came up in a story when someone was telling me his age (sɔpu is in fact 2-classifier: oko=1-CL, sɔpu=2-CL, rekwɔ=3-CL, and beyond that the generic classifier is -wɔ; something funny going on with the 20 variant, which begs the question of what that supposedly 0 -sɔ actually is—perhaps some kind of nominal meaning “10 unit”, which would explain the use of the classifier form?) Interesting if you consider the difference between Thulung and Koyi—both communities of about the same sizes, yet Koyi has a productive (and used) numeral system, whereas Thulung has borrowed almost the entire system from Nepali.

Practically, most things are not counted beyond 27 in Kosarek society anyway. When money is used, Indonesia numerals are often used, unless one states the Kosarek numeral as “ten ‘seribu’” (seribu being an Indonesian denomination of money of 1,000 rupiah) or sometime simply “ten” (with the expectation that the other person understands which denomination is intended whether 1,000, or 5,000, or 100,000 rupiah). Having said this, many Kosarek people are not aware of different denominations of money and must rely on a friend of relative to inform them whether it is the correct denomination or not. If the thing referred to is in a multitude, (such as a hundred or so warriors) they may simply say “teng-tengne”, with the idea of being innumerable. Although theoretically they could be precise if they took the time to count, this seems to almost never be done"

The numerals refer to body parts, where the suffix ‘bare’ is added. When counting the specific body parts is usually touched. They start with the left hand and go via the head to down to the right hand. When going down the suffix ‘dara’ is added: so left part up = 1-14, right part down = 15-28. The last one (28) = selek-dak-nak-la. Dakna means I finish. So that means that it’s the end. One round is called deng. People make a movement with their right hand over the left hand up till the head when they say deng. If they mean many more times they call it deng-deng and make this movement with the arm twice.

Only the numbers one and two occur naturally in recorded texts, with numbers from 3 to 10 being expressed holding up fingers. The term for 1 usually carries the diminutive suffix -tsök. Note on dialects: There are three dialects: Kapishtana, Mawi and Chema. The list above is from the Kapishtana dialect. With respect to numbers, the Mawi and Chema dialects differ from the Kapishtana dialect only in that the term for hand is mɨ'kɨn. Note on homophony: “Kulina-Pano” is a problematic term in that there are actually two languages called Kulina in the Panoan family (in addition to the Kulina language in the Arawan family). Following my terminology, Kulina of the Curuçá River is the obsolescent language described here. Kulina of the Olivença is an extinct Panoan language once spoken in Brazil along the Amazon River near the town of São Paulo de Olivença, documented by Johann von Spix in 1820 and published in the following book: Martius, Carl Friedrich Phil. von. 1867. Beiträge zur Ethnographie und Sprachenkunde Amerika's zumal Brasiliens. Leipzig: Friedrich Fleischer. These two languages are in different branches of the Panoan family. See the following paper for details. Fleck, David W. 2007. “Did the Kulinas become the Marubos?: A linguistic and ethnohistorical investigation.” Tipití, Journal of The Society for the Anthropology of Lowland South America, 5(2):137-207. My paper contains an appended comparative list which includes Spix’s Kulina of Olivença numbers and the Kulina of the Curuçá River numbers listed in the table above; I reproduce here the part of the appendix containing the numbers: Kuina of Olivencá Kulina of the Curucá River Marubo number 1 uüty epá(-tsik) wistí-Sta number 2 rabii dabíd rabíbakín, rabíki number 3 taküma mitʂáte tédtsik rabinin takíma number 4 taküyuwukuin mitʂáte tédtsik tákii mamí, takíya mamí number 5 takütakurasi mitʂáte tedí takima mikasi number 6 ytscha (no term) (no term) number 10 nuküwümikyu mittáte tedí mibi amáriti, mibiti Note: the form ytscha probably meant ‘many’ Sociolinguistic situation: The Kulinas of the Curuçá Rivers lived along various tributary streams of the Curuçá River in Peru. The Matses raided and exterminated the speakers of all three of these dialects in the 1950s and 1960s, save several dozen women and children whom they captured, and a handful who escaped. The captives who remain alive (about 30) live in Matses villages in Peru and Brazil where they speak only Matses; I have found only 5 who remember their language moderately well. Of the ones who escaped, three men remain alive: one lives in the Brazilian town of Tabatinga where he speaks Portuguese and has forgotten most of his language; the other two men live with Matses on the Curuçá River. Some Kulinas were in partial contact with Brazilians before the raids, but they never learned Portuguese or had enough contact to incorporate the Portuguese number system. They sometimes use Spanish or Portuguese numbers when they speak in Matses, but the Kulina language simply never developed a way to express most numbers verbally. Phonology: the list above is represented phonemically. The table below lists the phonemes and major allomorphs. Kulina-Pano phonemes (major allophones in parentheses) represented with IPA symbols.

The form for 50 differs from 5 in containing yiʔku rather than yi.ku, though it is worth noting that Boas represents the form for 5 as yiʔku. The form for 9 contains the form meaning 10; what precedes (qayk-) is not obviously analysable, though it is plausible that it historically contains the negative morpheme qa, though the -yk- has no obvious source. The form for 22 clearly contains the form for 20 and the form for 2.

The Kwazá numeral system is quinary and partially based on finger counting. The only true numeral roots are 1 and 2. The numerals 3 and 4 are adverbs, whereas 5 is a verb-noun compound meaning 'end of hand'. For numerals above 10 often Portuguese forms are used now. Some people say that in Kwazá you only count until seven. There seem to be only two original lexemes involved in the cardinal numeral system; the word relating to numbers one and two. There are no names for the fingers of the hand, and no-one could confirm any relation between the numerals and the possible obsolete finger names. Counting itself is more complicated and is accompanied by specified symbolic gesture of the fingers. When counting 'one', one holds the little finger of one hand in the other hand (either right of left), holding the counted hand in a vertical position with it's back turned away from the speaker. And 'two' is counted keeping the little and the ring fingers between the fingers of the other hand, and so on until the index finger is included at 'four'. At 'five' one grab the pulse or the hand itself. Counting 'six' the system changes and one of the hands is spread vertically, with the back turned towards the speaker, while the other hand is fist in the same position with only the thumb turned up into the air. One of the alternatives for 'six' ' akɨˈhɨ̃ akɨˈhɨ̃ akɨˈhɨ̃ 'means something like 'two, two, two', and the gesture accompanying this is the thumbs of the hands ( which are in vertical position with their backs turned towards the speaker). Higher numbers can be expressed through a coordinating construction using the morpheme -tja. It seems as if there are different possibilities to express these numbers. Note on phonetic symbolsː [j] is palatal approximant, [ β] an implosive labial stop."

The data were taken from Jocotepec Chinantec dialect. 60 is transcribed as ' [t̪ɵ̃̆²⁴ lɞ̆²⁴.ɡʸæ̝³ ɾɛ³.ʣɨ̆͡ĭ ɡʸæ̝²⁴]', 70 as [t̪ɵ̃̆²⁴ lɞ̆²⁴.ɡʸæ̝³ ɾɛ³.ʣɨ̆͡ĭ ɡʸæ̝ː²³ ], 80 as [t̪ɵ̃̆²⁴ lɞ̆²⁴.ɡʸæ̝³ ɾɛ³.ʣɨ̆͡ĭ ɡʸæ̝²⁴ɡʸæ̝̆³] and 90 as [t̪ɵ̃̆²⁴ lɞ̆²⁴.ɡʸæ̝³ ɾɛ³.ʣɨ̆͡ĭ t̪ɵ̃̆²⁴ lɞː²¹]. The words listed above only show a portion of what is going on in the language with regard to vowels and tones. The vowel phonology is very rich. Basically, there are four back vowels, upper and lower, unrounded and unrounded, respectively: /ɨ/, /u/, /ʌ/ (ø in the orthography), /o/. The actual realizations of these are different (lax and centralized). They also have palatal equivalents: /i/, /ø/ (ʉ in the orthography), /e/, /æ/ (ɑ̷ in the orthography – counts as rounded). The vowel system gets even more fun when the vowels are next to palatal consonants. The back unrounded vowels turn into a fronting diphthong [ɘ͡ɪ], [ɜ͡ɛ]; a word-final /n/ (historical with long vowels – it never gets pronounced, but still affects the vowel!) does the same thing and also changes an /o/ to [ɜ͡ɛ] or [ɐ], depending on the particular environment, and depalatalizes the front rounded vowels. And there’s more, when the initial consonant is palatalized (pronounced as a [ʸ] with velar and glottal consonants, otherwise not pronounced), then the front rounded vowels become diphthongs (when there is a historical, non-pronounced final /n/): [ɘ͡ɵ], [ɛ͡ɐ]. The tone system is also rather complex. Low tone is left unmarked (actually a low falling tone, especially with long vowels). High tone (v̄) is level. Falling tone (v̀) is an abrupt high-low tone. Falling rising (v̌) is realized as high-low-mid – rather hard to hear with short vowels (this tone only shows up on short vowels with verb forms). My theory is that both non-level tones developed from a laryngealized vowel originally. Each of these tones can have a ballistic equivalent. Since the theory I subscribe to is that ballistic stress has resulted from a historical word-final /h/, I’ve decided to use a ‘j’ in the orthography (the closest Spanish equivalent and already used word-initally for [h]). This tends to raise the tone. For low tone – mid-low (long vowel) or mid tone (short vowel). For high tone – steady high rising (long vowel) or slightly raised high (short vowel). For falling tone – the controlled/ballistic distinction has been lost (but it is still present in the neighboring dialects). For falling-rising – high rising (for long vowel – with more laryngeal pressure than with ballistic high) and slightly raised high (for short vowel – basically indistinguishable from ballistic high, but my language associate can tell the difference; I suspect he “feels” it, since I certainly don’t hear it!). Tone sandhi plays an important role in distinguishing ballistic high from ballistic falling-rising, as only the latter is affected. There are two rising tones: [v́] (low rising – low-mid) and [v́j] (high rising – mid-high). Both of these appear to have resulted from a tone sandhi type of tonal shift from ballistic falling-rising syllables (most notable in verb forms, but it’s not currently a productive pattern in speech). While my working orthography marks one as controlled and the other as ballistic, that’s just for simplicity’s sake, as there doesn’t appear to have been such a distinction with the original form. With regard to consonants, any consonant may be syllable-initial. In addition, the glottal consonants can combine with any nasal (resulting in a voiceless nasal), approximant, or sonorant. Any of the non-bilabial consonants can be palatalized as well, though the palatalization is only audible (showing up as [y]) on velar and glottal consonants. In addition, the velar stops can combine with [w]."

Mr. Brian Buuck, SIL International, October 1, 2008.",vigesimal,"Lealao Chinantec has a vigesimal system. Data transcribed by Brian Buuckː Like Sochiapan, this is not a language I'm really familiar with, less so than with Sochiapan, so you'll need to take the following with a grain of salt. From my interaction with my colleagues (Dr. Foris and Jim Rupp), I think it is safe to say that I am a lot more particular about actual phone pronunciation, and I believe that a lot of their symbols (particularly vowel symbols) are not very accurate from a phonetic standpoint. These are my assumptions regarding the vowels: Only unrounded vowels have palatalized forms. From looking at the Lealao dictionary at my disposal, it appears that the /o/ phoneme corresponds to the open back unrounded vowel in Jocotepec. And the /a/ phoneme corresponds to the /o/ phoneme. That would mean that /o/ is actually, underlyingly, an unrounded vowel, and /a/ is underlyingly a rounded vowel! That would seem a lot more bizarre if I was not aware of a similar tendency to a lesser extent in Lalana Chinantec (a dialect of the same language that Jocotepec belongs to). It appears that the stops correspond to those of Jocotepec. However, palatalization changes the voiceless velar stop ('k') to the voiceless palatal affricate. The voiced affricates (palatalized and non-palatalized versions) are like with Jocotepec as well – it may well be that they come from the missing voiced sibilant originally. The /f/ phoneme comes from /hw/. The /h/ can form syllable-initial consonant clusters with any approximant, any nasal (those are the voiceless nasal plus voiced nasal combinations listed), and with /l/. The same goes for Jocotepec, possibly for Sochiapan. Apparently, in Lealao, the /hw/ is pronounced as 'f'. While in Jocotepec, the glottal stop can form clusters with the same phones, this is apparently not permitted in Lealao (compare the number ""three"" between Lealao and Jocotepec), so the glottal stop has simply been dropped. The /v/ corresponds to the /w/ of Jocotepec, while the other symbols appear to have one-to-one correspondence.

Limassa is a language of the Baka-Gundi branch of the Mundu-Baka family and currently classified as Ubangi. In being the only securely known non-pygmy variety in the Baka-Gundi branch, Limassa may be the direct source of the Baka pygmy language complex. Limassa is spoken mainly in Bomassa on the Sangha River in the north of the Republic of the Congo. It is the traditional settlement of the Bomassa, who are accepted as the founders of this village. The village exists since 1920 and was originally called Ngolio (‘eagel’). Today it has ca. 400 inhabitants. The population of the village is multi-ethnic as well as multi-linguistic Further languages spoken in the village are the closely related Ngombe-Baka as well as the Bantu languages Ngundi and Mabenjele-Aka. According to several accounts, speakers may also be located outside Bomassa In the first half of the 20th century some Bomassa founded smaller settlements and fishing camps on the Sangha between Ouesso and Bayanga - Some of these settlements still exist today, e.g. Mombongo, Bounda and Molongodi. Furthermore, there is evidence of occasional encounters with speakers on the Cameroonian side of the Sangha."

They derive historically from the form used with masculine nouns in earlier Aramaic. The forms tˁlaˈhˁa and tilhˁa are used interchangeably, the second of these being the result of a syllabic restructuring (tilhˁa < tˁlaˈhˁa < tˁlaːˈtˁaː*). The has developed from an original *tˁ due to the pharyngalization of the word induced by the when contiguous with the preceding. In the variant form the pharyngalization of the first syllable has been lost. Numerals 11-19ː These also are invariable and derive historically from the form that was originally used with masculine nouns: Unlike tˁlaˈhˁa , the numeral is pronounced without pharyngalization. A pharyngal /ˁ/ occurs in the word that is a secondary development (< * tmaːayaː-'sar). This has apparently arisen as a result of the pharyngalization of the word, which, in turn, is likely to have been induced by the consonant /m/. The pharyngalization does not occur in the unit numeral tma'nya 'eight'. In the variant form tˁmaˁaya'sar the syllable containing the pharyngeal is split by an epenthetic vowel. Tensː The form tˁla'hi < tlaːtˁiːn *) exhibits pharyngalization of the initial consonant. Unlike tˁlaˈhˁa 'three'. however, the * tˁ shifts to /h/ but is not pharyngalized to /hˁ/ , probably due to the adjacent high vowel /i/. The alternative form for eighty tˁmaˁan'yi exhibits pharyngalization and the secondary development of the pharyngeal /ˁ/. Hundredsː 100.ʔimma, 200.

They derive historically from the form used with masculine nouns in earlier Aramaic. The form taha, which is pronounced velarized, has developed from tlatˠa. The velarization has developed from an original emphatic cluster * tˁlˁ, which occurs at the onset of the numeral in many NENA dialects. The medial * t̠ has been weakened to the laryngeal /h/. In some Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of the NENA area the numeral has the pharyngeal /h/, e.g. J. Sulemaniyya tˁlahˁa, which may have been a secondary development from /h/ in an emphatic environment. Numerals 11-19ː These also are invariable and derive historically from the form that was originally used with masculine nouns: Unlike taha , the numeral taltasːar is pronounced without velarization. Conversely, tmanesːar is pronounced velarized whereas tmanya is not velarized. Some of the Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of NENA area have the pharyngal consonant /ˁ/ in the form of the numeral '18', e.g. J. Sulemaniyya tˁmaˁni'sar, which may have been a secondary development conditioned by the emphatic articulation of the word. Tensː Note the velarization of tahi and tmoni. In some Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of the NENA area the numeral '80' contains the pharyngeal consonant /ˁ/, which has developed secondarily due to the emphatic environment. e.g. J.

My sociolinguistic data (43 hours of recorded speech of 21 Makuxi speakers) show that the speakers really only used the numbers from 1 to 10 in Makuxi, even though they claim to use Makuxi numbers from 1 to 20. In recorded speech, for eleven and above, the Makuxi informants used the numbers from Portuguese, the dominant language. Numbers for eleven and above do exist in the Makuxi language, as elicited from speakers, but are not generally used. It seems that counting beyond 10 was not important in Makuxi culture, since it was not a money-based culture. (2). Usually, the term kaisarî [ˌkaʲʃaˈrɨ] “equal to” is added after the number. (3). The Makuxi cardinal counting system is based on the 20 human digits (fingers and toes). There are four basic numbers: 1 = tiwin, 2 = esaakîne, 3 = eseurîwîne, 4 = esaakîrîrî. The remaining numbers are glossed as follows (I am using current Makuxi orthography): 5 = mia’ taikin hand half 6 = tiwin mia’ pona tîîmotai one hand of/to other-side 7 = esaakîne mia’ pona tîîmotai two hand of/to other-side 8 = eseurîwîne mia’ pona tîîmotai three hand of/to other-side 9 = esaakîrîrî mia’ pona tîîmotai four hand of/to other-side 10 = mia’ tamî’nawîrî hand all 11 = tiwin pu’ pona tîîmotai one foot of/to other-side 12 = esaakîne pu’ pona tîîmotai two foot of/to other-side 13 = eseurîwîne pu’ pona tîîmotai three foot of/to other-side 14 = esaakîrîrî pu’ pona tîîmotai four foot of/to other-side 15 = mai’ taikin pu’ pona tîîmotai or: pu’ taikin hand half foot of/to other-side foot half 16 = tiwin iratai pu’ pona tîîmotai one other foot of/to other-side 17 = esaakîne iratai pu’ pona tîîmotai two other foot of/to other-side 18 = eseurîwîne iratai pu’ pona tîîmotai three other f oot of/to other-side 19 = esaakîrîrî iratai pu’ pona tîîmotai four other foot of/to other-side 20 = pu’ tamî’nawîrî or: tiwin pemonkon foot all one person 21 = tiwin pemonkon moropai tiwin one person and one 22 = tiwin pemonkon moropai esaakîne one person and two And so on for numbers 23 to 29. 30 = tiwin pemonkon moropai mia’ tamî’nawîrî one person and (10) hand all 40 = esaakîne pemonkon two persons 50 = esaakîne pemonkon moropai mia’ tamî’nawîrî two persons and (10) hand all 60 = eseurîwîne pemonkon three persons 70 = eseurîwîne pemonkon moropai mia’ tamî’nawîrî three persons and (10) hand all 80 = esaakîrîrî pemonkon four persons 90 = eseurîwîne pemonkon moropai mia’ tamî’nawîrî four persons and (10) hand all 100 = mia’ taikin pemonkon (5) hand half persons"

In Yelmek, the word for hand is /alpɔ/, which apparently does not have anything to do with counting. In Maklew the word is /bl/, which makes five ‘one hand’. it seems to be used for ‘ten’ too, but I don’t know what the other part in the word and they spelled /bl/ as part of the word in both cases. To make it even more confusing, at some point they gave me /blinage-blmepola/ as the equivalent of ‘three’ and I think I have seen the prefix in other cases to mean ‘one further’. Moreover, when I ask for an example sentence for ‘ten’, he spontaneously gave me a sentence, which translates as ‘I have five male dogs and five female dogs’ meaning he has ten dogs, so I am not sure if this ‘ten’ is really used for counting."

In the above data, all syllables carry low tone, except for the final syllable of /-ani/, and the morphemes /hik/ and /han/ which all carry a high tone. The specific numerals are just those for ‘one’ and ‘two’. ‘Three’ is a composite form. These numerals, 1-3, are commonly used forms. The use of the other composite numerals listed in the chart (4, 5, and 10) is not very common, but possible and heard occasionally. Beyond these, there are of course additional ways to say other numerals by simply mixing the above components, but these composite constructions are never found outside of very deliberate elicited responses, and will vary according to the speaker. This makes me conclude that these extra constructions are not numerals at all, but simply permissible constructions that an individual could create, but that are not recognized or accepted or used by the community in any social setting. For that reason I have not included any of the many creative ways of saying things such as ‘37’. Beyond the word for 3, they will typically just use the word /kanih/ ‘many’. If mathematical precision is in focus or required, then they will resort to the whole set of Portuguese numerals as loan words, or they will simply employ code shifting and the whole conversation switches to Portuguese.

For ‘eight’ he felt that it somehow indicated ‘four on both sides’ again with reference to fingers held up to indicate the number. (The root for ‘4’ is /ni/, although it’s unclear how that gets modified by /china/ which isn’t a current Lungu word. For ‘nine’, we see again imbali ‘side’.

Because I don't know what the first parts of these - ""nʲol"" and ""oːntəl"" - exactly mean. I suspect they mean something like ""without 2"" and ""without 1"", like in Finnish, where ""kahdeksan"" '8' has the root ""kahde-"" '2', and ""yhdeksän"" '9' has the root ""yhde-"" '1'. The problem is that in Mansi ""nʲol"" and ""oːntəl"" do not seem to be similar to ""kit(iɣ)"" or ""akʷa""... That's why i've added the question mark to these translations, but maybe you could provide some information below the table, for example: ""Numerals ""8"", ""9"", ""80"", ""90"" are compound numerals. I don't know what is the exact meaning of the first component - ""nʲol"" or ""oːntəl"" - but the structural meaning of the whole compounds could be described as follows: ""Two units* (nʲol) or one unit* (oːntəl) lacking to the completion of a higher order unit - be it ten (low) or hundred (saːt). *Note that the ""unit"" may be a unit (for numerals 8 and 9) or a ten (for numerals 80 and 90), so ""nʲolsa:t"" means 80 (2 tens lacking to the completion of a hundred, 100-20) and not *98 (100-2)."" Another thing is with 100， saːt (it's exactly the same numerals as 7) It could be added, that: A word ""janıɣ"" 'big' could be added before this numeral to disambiguate it from 7. janıɣ 'big' + sa:t '7' = 'the big seven'."

Most people only use Mengen numbers up to 5 or 10, and prefer Tok Pisin for higher numbers. Other notes: 1. The voice on the recording is from Mrs Felicitas Lurume (born in 1970), from the village of Poro near Malmal in the West Pomio district. Mrs Lurume is a teacher at Makain Elementary School and she has given written consent for this recording to be published on the Internet. 2. Mengen has a 7-vowel system /i, e, E, ɑ, ɔ, o, u/, but the contrast between /e/ and /E/ and between /o/ and /ɔ/ appears to be neutralised in closed syllables. 3. Final vowels following consonants are often not pronounced, e.g. / tɑŋuˈlel/ for ‘10’. 4. Word and phrase-medial /b/ and /ɡ/ have fricative allophones [B] and [Ä], in some cases even phrase-initially. The word /bɑ/ ‘and’ is therefore usually pronounced [Bɑ]. 5. The word /kɑinɑ/ in the numeral for ‘20’ and higher has a variant /kEnɑ/."

The numbers 'five' and 'ten' are expressed by NPs making reference to hands and the numbers 'eleven' through 'nineteen' by reference to hands and feet. Visual motions often accompany counting by this traditional system. Starting with the thumb of the left hand, the finger tips are brought together for numbers one through five. Six through ten would add the finger tips of the right hand to the clustered tips of the left, again starting with the thumb and ending with all ten finger tips together. People seated while counting beyond ten have been observed to touch the clustered fingers to the required number of toes. More recently, however, these traditional numbers are falling out of use and are being replaced with numbers borrowed from English via Tok Pisin. Note that the word ‘hipa’ (hand), the word ‘huiqä’ (finger) can be substituted. The words ‘yätu(ŋi)’ (above) and ‘bu(ŋi)’ (below) can be omitted.

There are, nevertheless, tallied on the fingers belong with the thumb of the left hand and (presumably) proceeding along the index, middle, ring, and little fingers, 6 being tallied on the left wrist. Although Smith and Weston give no data beyond the tally word for 23, it seems likely that the original Mianmin systems possessed a 27-cycle and utilized 13 body-parts on the left-hand side of the body, the nose, which is the mid-point of the cycle (lying one the body's vertical axis of symmetry) and then a further 13 body-part one the right-hand side of the body, the symmetrical counterparts of the first 13. Smith and Weston ( 1974, p.50) note that: 'counting begins with the left thumb, followed by the fingers of the left hand; then up to the left-hand side of the body and down the right. In coming down the right side, people become vague in their counting,' and the word for 'many' homon' is used in the preference. In fact, homon is commonly used for anything over five. Jean Smith (2011) told me actually the only one that I can remember using the word for wrist as six was the pastor. The younger people just did not use the counting system at all and most of them did not know it. They compromised with the asuke asuke make system instead.

In earlier days, in counting, one started with the little finger of the left hand, ending with the thumb of the right hand, which represents number ten. Then, both hands were clapped together and at the same time fee was uttered. To continue counting, the toes were used to count up to twenty; starting with the little toe of the left foot, ending at the big toe of the right foot. The custom to use one's toes for counting is almost abandoned. Also, nowadays many Moi people use the Indonesian numerals in daily speech. An exception to this is the counting of kain timur (cloths which form the dowry), which is always done in Moi. A reason for this might be that the kain timur complex is a phenomenon that is deeply rooted in the Moi culture. The numerals from six onwards are morphologically complex. The numbers six up to and including ten have an element ma, which, very likely, is derived form maafuk 'five'. The meaning of the (possible) constituents taanim in the numeral six, tanan in the numerals six up to and including ten, and timaali in the numerals eleven up to and including nineteen, could not be established. For the number twenty: nee-meele-w-aagi person-one-3S:M-die:S'One person dead' (= twenty). For the numbers from twenty one up to and including thirty nine the equivalent of 'One person dead and a second person's n finger'(s)' are used. Some examples are given: nee-meele-w-aagi-nee-aali-wi-nin-meele, person-one-3S:M-die:S-person-two-3S:M-finger-one, 'One person dead [and] a second person's finger' (= twenty one), nee-meele-w-aagi-nee-aali-wi-nin-matanan-meele, person-one-3S:M-die:S-person-two-3S:M-finger-?-one, 'One person dead [and] a second person's six fingers' (= twenty six), nee-meele-w-aagi-nee-aali-wi-nin-fee, person-one-3S:M-die:S-person-two-3S:M-finger-ten, 'One person dead [and] a second person's ten fingers' (= thirty). The numeral forty is formed in accordance with the expression for twenty: nee-aali-y-iigi, person-two-3P:H-die:P, Two persons dead' (= forty). Other numerals are formed in the same way as is discussed above. Multiples of ten up to and including hundred are: 50. nee-aali-y-iigi-nee-tooluk-wi-nin-fee, 60. nee-tooluk-y-iigi, 70. nee-tooluk-y-iigi-nee-fak-wi-nin-fee, 80. nee-fak-y-iigi, 90. nee-fak-y-iigi-nee-maafuk-wi-nin-fee, 100 nee-maafuk-y-iigi (in listing) or witin meele (in isolation) Multiples of hundred are formed with witin.

This language might have few traditional words for numbers. Muniche is an indigenous language historically spoken on the Paranapura river in the Peruvian Amazon. It seems to be a linguistic isolate, meaning that it is not related to any living language. The Muniche people and their language have been known by several names. The name 'Muniche' dates to the earliest colonial records in the 17th century, and corresponds with the name used by current semispeakers. Variants and other names include Munichi(s), Otonabes, Otonavis, and Otonahuis. Some authors have identified 'Paranapura' as an alternate name because the Muniches live on the Paranapura River, yet this appears to conflate the Muniche language with another, extinct language. The last fully fluent speakers of Muniche were born between 1915 and 1925; the language was moribund by the early 1930s. Language shift was probably taking place from Muniche to both Quechua and Spanish from the beginning of the 20th century. Previous linguistic work on Muniche is extremely limited. The most important work is Gibson (1996), a sketch of Muniche phonology and verbal morphology based on the author's undergraduate thesis. Other than Gibson's work, documentation of Muniche is restricted to four brief wordlists.” Additional notes about the counting system in this language: Muniche speakers have had contact with Quechuan languages, which may have influenced their numeral system. At the time of collecting data, more research needs to be done to find out which variety of Quechua that Muniche speakers have been in contact with. Numerals 7 and 8 in Muniche bear resemblance to Proto-Quechua forms, loosely transcribed here: Proto-Quechua+ 1. *suk 2. *ishkay 3. *kimsa 4. *çusku, 5. *tawa 6. *pichqa 7. *suqta 8. *qançis"

The digits are sererated with the conjunction /u/. The excetion is when zeros are next to each other, then the digits are numbered. Thus 100 is /ju u lə sɛfɾi/[1] and 1000 is /ju u çiraj zɛfɾi/.

The numeral system once went from 1 till 20, but not beyond that. Only the numerals from 1 to 5 and the number 10 are still widely used. All others have been replaced by numerals from the national language. As in many small and ""simple"" societies numerals don't appear to have been important, and as you can see they are rather complicated. Often the Nadëb will show a certain number of fingers and just say da hɛ̃ ""this many"" instead of using the descriptive phrase that would go with that particular numeral. More important were and still are quantifiers (not exact numbers), such as: po'wɔp hɛ̃ ""a few/some"". ha'jɔ̃ŋ ""many"" (non- human), ha'jok̚ ""many"" (human) ta'tɯbm ""a few that can be found once in a while"" (like a certain type of tree or fish) and its antonym kanekadn to name just a few. Introduction of mathematics has created a bigger need for numerals than was normally the case, and this need has mostly been filled in by the Portuguese number system. NOTES: 1. The symbol ' indicates stress. Since all of the numerals are actual noun phrases, the stress indicates stress at the phrase level. 2. Oral vowels influence the following nasal, obligating it to become pre-stopped. This is indicated in the chart above with the corresponding raised (superscript) stop. The only ones that are relevant in the numeral phrases above are ""b"" before m (bm), and ""ɡ"" before ŋ (ɡŋ). In the orthography we do not write pre-stopping of nasals that follow oral vowels since we can apply a rule. 3. The consonants that are followed by a raised (superscript) glottal are what has been analyzed as ""post-glottalised plosives"" – that is t? and g?. In fast speech t? is almost undistinguishable from the double articulation t͡ʃ and the ɡ? is almost undistinguishable from the velar ejective kʼ. 4. j = palatal approximant. 5. w = voiced labial-velar approximant."

Please note the following: 3-three: toyoh – The number for three, pronounced “toyoh” has an initial phoneme that presents as a flap ‘r’ intervocalically but as a ‘t’ in word-initial position and as an unreleased ‘t’ in word-final position. Therefore, in the numbers thirteen (‘songui pe royoh’) and twenty-three (‘lungui pe royoh’) it is pronounced and spelled with the ‘r’ but in word-initial position, it is pronounced and spelled by Nali speakers using a ‘t’. 6-six: annoh – Spoken Nali often contracts words by dropping out vowels in multi-syllable words. The number six, when pronounced in a counting sequence is pronounced with a lengthened ‘n’ which is a contraction where there would normally be a vowel ‘o’ between two ‘n’ sounds. If it were talking about six items like six coconuts (‘niu’), then one would say “niu manonoh” and there would be a prefixed ‘m’ plus one would pronounce the vowel ‘o’ between the two ‘n’ sounds. 7-seven: andrtoyoh – Another contraction occurs within the sequence of numbers 7, 8, and 9, where the Nali uses what you probably will recognize from other Austronesian languages – a ‘subtraction’ indicator. Seven is ‘less three’, eight is ‘less two’, and nine is ‘less one’ – as you will recognize those three stems from earlier in the list with the added prefix ‘andro-’ (‘less’). However the ‘o’ in ‘andro-’ sometimes is not pronounced in spoken Nali except before ‘sih’ (in the number 9, it is ‘androsih’). The ‘o’ has been dropped in the contracted numbers 7 (‘andrtoyoh’) and 8 “andrluwoh”. (Note that because the ‘t’ in andrtoyoh is not intervocalic, is presents as a ‘t’ rather than a flap ‘r’ as noted above.) In certain people’s speech, however (whether determined by a speaker’s dialect or idiolect, I am not certain) numbers like 8 ‘andrluwoh’, which is a contraction of “androluwoh” sometimes is contracted instead by dropping the ‘u’ in ‘luwoh’ rather than the ‘o’ in ‘andro-’ and, thus, the number 8 can present as “androlwoh”. 40- forty: hangui or haangui – The number can have a lengthened ‘a’ sound, written here using doubling of the vowel – ‘aa’. The reason for this is not completely clear, but a little information might lead to an educated guess. The Nali number system has a multitude of counting “classes” depending on what is being counted. The system for simply counting the cardinal numbers “one, two, three…” is represented by the same class as that used for counting stones or coconuts. But there are other systems in use for other counting. In most of those systems, the ha- prefix occurs on the number for one of an item. (hakap – one tree leaf; hakol – one place/village; hakou – one tree; hamou – one person/living thing/animal; etc.). To distinguish between ‘one coconut fruit’ and ‘one coconut tree’, the number word carries the appropriate class marker. In this way ‘niu sih’ (one coconut) and ‘niu hakou’ (one coconut tree) can be easily distinguished by the number word which belongs to a certain counting class. Similarly the prefix ‘lu-‘ indicates two of the items listed above (lukap; lukol; lukou; lumou) and the ‘ti- prefix indicates three have the prefix ti- (tikap; tikol; tikou; timou). When you want to count four of an item, however, the prefix is ha- again (as in the basic ‘hahiu’ for the counting number ‘four’, but in order to distinguish it from the singular, the ‘a’ is lengthened in speech. Hence four (when counting leaves) would be pronounced ‘haakap’, and four people ‘haamou’. The lengthening may be a compensation for numbers used when in the act of in counting, versus numbers used in general speaking. For instance, if you had a row or school children and you started to walk along the line counting them, you would count “hamou, lumou, timou, haamou, yimou, …” But if you wanted to report that you just saw one child or two children or three children or four children walking down the street your would report that you saw ‘hamou’ (1), or ‘malmou’ (2 contracted from ‘malumou’) or ‘matimou’(3) or ‘mahamou’ (4). The prefix ma- indicates that you are going to state a number (greater than one). While you would report seeing one child as ‘hamou’, you would report seeing four children as ‘mahamou’. So there is no problem distinguishing between one child and four children, because of the prefix ma- on the numbers after 1. But if you were just looking and counting out loud, you would not use the ‘ma-‘ prefix. You would simply count “hamou, lumou, timou …” as noted above. But when you got to four, you may want to do something to distinguish between hamou (1) and mahamou (4) when you were not using the ma- prefix. This is achieved by lengthening the ‘a’ and saying ‘hamou, lumou, timou, haamou…’ while looking at, for example, a row of children. Thus, sometimes the lengthened ‘a’ in ‘haa-‘ indicates the number 4. This has been written by Nali speakers as ‘aa’, though in normal speech, you would more likely hear ‘mahamou’ rather than ‘mahaamou’, since the ‘ma-‘ helps to indicate the number 4, without having to lengthen the ‘a’ sound. However, in writing there has been a general an inconsistency in writing ‘a’ or ‘aa’ in words that represent the number four (4). Thus, in the number forty (40) one may find it written or pronounced with or without lengthening of the vowel ’a’ – either ‘hangui’ or haangui’. Other numbers noted in parentheses/brackets: Because of contracting words and dropping out some vowels, pronunciation of various words differs from speaker to speaker. Items included in parentheses/brackets represent alternate pronunciations or basic forms without the contractions. The phonetic guide to assist with the pronunciation for the numbers listed above can be found in the preliminary Organized Phonology Data file for the Nali language at: http://www.sil.org/pacific/png/pubs/0000264/Nali.pdf"

March 23, 2011.",,"Traditionally the speakers of the Nambu language, who are called Keraakie, used the day or night to measure small durations, but only up to three. This measurement of short durations is noted in their use of a limited number of linguistic items, such as today: ganoso; tomorrow/yesterday: kai, and two days in the past or in the future: naambat. The Keraakie also use a limited number of numerals: one: eembru, two: somboi, three: naambi, with the time unit of day or night to indicate lengths of time. Francis Williams (anthropologist who visited the Nambu speakers during 1926-33, writing Papuans of the Trans Fly) mentioned in his field notes a counting system using parts of the body, such as the fingers of one hand, then the fingers of the other hand. The number eleven was the forearm (dikav dikav), twelve was the elbow (dengwa), thirteen was the upper arm (tevi), fourteen was the shoulder (minu) and fifteen was the chest or heart (tikav). This is no longer in use and has been replaced by the Western numerical system, but the Keraakie have another numerical system based on counting yams in groups of six, which is still in use today. Williams mentioned that this system was adopted from the people west of the Morehead River, but his version differs from the modern one, which is shown below: six yams is an eembru for = 6 six eembru for make up one ferta eembru = 36 six ferta make up one taromba = 216 six tarumba make up one daameno = 1,296 six daameno make up one werameka = 7,776 six werameka make up one wiwi = 46,656 six wiwi make up one meemee wim = 279,936 Although the potential was there, the Keraakie did not use this system to measure time or other objects."

( 2019) I have recently been working on describing Ncane numbers in more detail and today I learned something that might be of interest to you. In our language, as well as many others in our area, the number 20 is m̄bāŋ (or a some cognate). This form is used as the base for forming multiples of 10, but it is for the most part obviously unrelated formally to the number 10. So I was looking at descriptions of other languages in the area to see if they give a plausible explanation of this word. It turns out that Fransen (1995) makes a hypothesis about Limbum 20 that is logical. The Limbum 10 is rvʉ̄ʉ̀ (the form is reported somewhat differently in the more recent observations by Ginny Bradley and Frances Wepnong). This form looks like it could be marked for class 5 (r-). The plural class pairing with class 5 is usually class 6 (m-). So, Fransen suggests (with direction from van Reenen) that 20 is derived from the plural form of 10 plus the number 2 (báā), with the realization of mbáā. The historical form is posited as m-vʉ̄ʉ̀ m-báā (c6-ten c6-two, literally ‘tens two’), and eventually shortened to m-báā ‘twenty’."

The digits in the one's positions for 1-5 are prefixed with gender 19/26 concord (numbering follows Hombert 1980). So, ""11"" has fi- 'cl19' preceding the number one mimia. Note that there is some vowel harmony and other mophophonemics occurring. ""12"" has muN- 'cl26' preceding the number two fɛ. And so on. In fact, it's possible that the fijɛ occuring in the 20's is the word 'thing' as they have the same morphological shape and I've heard reports of similar cases in other Cameroonian languages. The concord marking changes to match the noun when using the numbers with nouns (and is still limited to the digits 1-5 in the one's positions). When used with nouns, the concord also occurs with the single digits 1-5 (eg, fi-ɲi fi-mimia 'one bird', mu-ɲi muɱ-fɛ 'two birds'). -""100"" is intrinsically gender 3/4, which in Nchane has a labialized initial consonant marking singular and presumably 0 marking plural (ie, #Cw 'cl3' and #C 'cl4', eg, gwaŋ 'hill' and gaŋ 'hills'). -""1000"" is intrinsically gender 1/2, which is marked 0-/ba- respectively (eg 0-na 'cow' and ba-na 'cows'). Note that for ""2000"", the number two (fɛ) is modifying 'thousand' and therefore takes class 2 concord (since ntʃugɛ is gender 1/2).

Nzadi is a virtually unknown Bantu language spoken along the Kasai River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. During the academic year 2008-2009 we were fortunate to be able to work together when the third author, a native speaker of Nzadi, was a student at the Jesuit School of Theology at Berkeley. In Fall 2008, Simon Tukumu served as a language consultant for an undergraduate field methods course, jointly conducted by the first two authors, and attended by nine Berkeley undergraduate students and one visiting graduate student from Madrid. When the three authors originally met in the Winter of 2008 to see if Simon could serve as the language consultant for Linguistics 140, we were not only unaware of any previous work on Nzadi—or in fact, of any previous mention of the language in the literature: For example, there was (and as of June 2011 still is) no mention of Nzadi in the on-line Ethnologue (http://www.ethnologue.com/). We later discovered that a Belgian scholar, Nico Burssens, had collected word lists in the area, including Nzadi, which he had sent to the second author for inclusion in the Comparative Bantu On-Line Dictionary (CBOLD) database in the mid 1990s. That was it, the complete record on the Nzadi language.2 A Grammar of Nzadi After the course ended, with five of the original field methods students, we decided to continue our investigations as a Study Group during the Spring 2009 semester. Our goal was to add to the previously recorded and analyzed materials which could then be assembled into a grammar of this heretofore unstudied Bantu language. The current grammar is based on information obtained from elicitations as well as three narratives (Texts 1-3) spoken by Simon Tukumu, with all sessions being recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by the members of the project. While our goal was to cover as much ground as possible the resulting grammar is obviously limited by the logistics (cf. §1.4). As will be seen, the chapters which present thephonology and morphology are more comprehensive than those dealing with syntactic,semantic and pragmatic issues. Our goal has been to cover the basics in hopes that the work will be useful to Bantu scholars, general linguists, and to the speakers of Nzadi themselves. Needless to say, this is a first grammar, which we hope will be followed up by other studies."

Over the years since Tok Pisin and English education were introduced to the area many people no longer use the Ngaing language numbers beyond five, preferring the shorter Tok Pisin or English numbers.

Worrbbamh is used for both 3 and 4. My interpretation is that it really means ""a few"". A plausible hypothesis is that it was also used for 5 until a ?recent? past but then langu-wanjingh-walung came in as an innovation. A couple of remarks: - These numerals behave like other Dalabon nominals. i.e they can modify another nominal, be the head of an NP, or be used predicatively. - Burrkunh and yabbunh are relatively interchangeable for *two*. I haven’t been able to identify a difference between them. I think burrkunh is more standard, e.g., if you count you’ll use burrkunh. - Langu-wanjingh-walung is the standard expression to say “on one hand” eg. in “one of my hands is dirty—but the other one is not”. I’ve never heard any expression with langu “hand” being used for ten. - After 5, people use baka (or reduplicated form bakabaka), also a nominal, or the suffix -ngong. - A possible explanation for this funny counting pattern wanjingh, burrkunh, worrbamh, worrbamh, langu-wanjingh-walung, would be that worrbamh means “a few”, with a series wanjingh (one), burrkunh (two), worrbamh (a few), baka (several/a lot). And langu-wanjingh-walung may be a recent borrowing imposed over this pattern. Counting goes: wanjingh, burrkunh, worrbbamh, langu-wanjingh-walung, that is, worrbamh is not repeated twice. Langu-wanjingh-walung is far less frequent than the other numerals."

The Mambila ethnic group in present day Taraba State, Nigeria migrated from Central Africa around 3000 BC and eventually settled in a place called Kimi, southern part of Cameroon. After many years of inhabiting Kimi, political (Jihad) and economic crisis rocked the settlement and resulted in a new wave of migration and dispersal. Hence, people groups proceeded under different leaders and settled at various points along the Plateau. The Bang people in the course of these migrations settled in their present day location along the Nigerian-Cameroon border. Owing to war, intruding forces, neighbouring conquerors, land ownership and need for protection, Bang people sought shelter on the Plateau along the remotest part resulting in further fragmentation. Language information Len-Mambila is a variety of the Mambiloid cluster classified as North Bantoid language saddling both sides of the Nigeria-Cameroon border in Taraba State and Adamawa region, respectively. It is spoken by agrarian community in Bang villages, (Bang 3 Corner, Bang Down, Bang Leng, Bang Leng-Lip, Bang Lycop and Saam) of Sarduna Local Government Area, Taraba State; with diminishing number of speakers. It is used alongside Fulfulde and other Mambila lects by most residents. Notesː ‘ŋ̄gàp’ – means calabash. It is indigenously used as a unit of measurement because of the belief that a calabash would hold a hundred kolanut. Moreso, according to one of my consultants, Bang people counted kolanut in hundreds which equates to the amount a calabash can hold. ‘wún’ – means rope. So Bang people refer to 1000 as a rope alluding the tradition of tying a rope to ten calabashes to indicate some kind of bundle."

Nocte has the prefix ruwok- ‘ten’ which builds the numerals twenty to ninety nine. For cardinal numerals hundred onwards Nocte has tʃɑ-tʰé ‘one hundred’. Nocte like Deuri does not take any additive marker to build the cardinal numbers eleven to nineteen. But unlike Deuri which retains the mu- prefix, in Nocte the prefix wan- does not affix to itʃʰí ‘ten’ from numbers 14 to 19 instead the vowel i- is dropped when the higher digits are formed by addition. In Nocte the base n is followed by y. The cardinals 11 to 19 where the peripheral itʃʰí ‘ten’ combines with numerals 1 to To build numerals from twenty to twenty nine the prefix ruwok- ‘ten’ multiplies with the base numeral ni ‘two’ to derive the cardinal ruwokni ‘twenty’. Nocte has two variants for ‘ten’ itʃʰí a base numeral and ruwok- a prefix. The base numeral ni ‘two’ multiplies with ruwok- ‘ten’ to form ruwokni ‘twenty’. The derived cardinal then adds up with the core numerals 1 to 9 to build the higher numbers. In Nocte we see the base n multiplies with x and then y is added to build higher numbers. The prefix wan- is dropped for numbers 24 to 29. Note that we observe that Nocte numerals show mid and high tone. Bugun numerals have three tones high, mid and low. It must be noted that tone in Bugun is disappearing mainly due to the impact of languages like Hindi, Nepali, Assamese and others. Tone variations are hardly noticed in Bugun, Deuri and Nocte due to language contact. As most speakers use Hindi, Assamese or Nepali in their everyday life, they have lost tone in their native languages. Also due to lack of active use of native language they can no longer distinguish tone variation nor can they use them."

The data provided here is provisional (specially the stress position, the stress syllable is underlined), and has to be checked with at least a few more speakers of the language in order to be conclusive. 2- The Northern Alta phonological system has not been established yet, therefore no phonemic chart is added. 3- The data was elicited from two different speakers. Both had to take their time when providing numerals beyond ten. When asking the numbers from thirty to ninety, the first speaker provided the number thirty in Tagalog, and forty to ninety were provided in Spanish. 4- The second speaker, whose recording is the one provided here, could give the numbers but in some cases needed the help of her friend. For example, when recording the number two, the language assistant provides the Tagalog form dalawa and then is corrected by another speaker, giving the proper Alta form duwa. The same problem is found in the number twelve where the speaker proposes labin dalawa, instead of the expected labin duwa. The same problem happens with the number six. The speaker gives an alta form innem (e is a schwa), but inconsistently provides ?anim (probably the Tagalog form) for sixteen and sixty. 16 labin ?anim 60 ?anim ?a pulo 5- It is not clear at this point if hundreds, tens and units form one or several phonological and grammatical words. 6- The tens and the units are linked by the linker at: 23: duwa ?apulo at tatlo The connector can be attached to the tens as it can be heard in the recording: 24: duwa ?apulot ?apat More information about these phonological changes will be provided after studying them in depth. 7- Considering the form for number 1: issah, the form issah ?a li:bo should be expected for the number one thousand, the aspiration however disappears, probably due to the following glottal stop."

All diphthongs in Yuwan are combinations of a particular vowel plus /i/. aː aa, ai; uː uu, ui; iː ii, ɨː ɨi, ɨɨ [1] /e/ is used for a small number of loanwords from Standard Japanese (e.g., /sinsjei / ‘teacher’) or interjections (e.g., /ude/ ‘hey’). [2] /p/ often appears as a geminate in the combination of stem and affixes (or clitics). Yuwan has a very restricted number of lexicons that have /p/ (12 lexemes so far), where non-geminated lexemes are pon+wata ‘big belly,’ anpəə ‘appearance,’ piri ‘tail end,’ and mai= nu pɨɨ (hip=GEN hole) ‘anus,’ excluding onomatopoeia and alleged modern loan words. [3] /z/ can be realized as [(d͡)z] (or [(d͡)ʑ]) in Yuwan; however, we regard it as a voiced counterpart of the fricative /s/ since /s/ can precede all the vowels that /z/ can precede, but the affricate /c/cannot precede all of these vowels. For example, there are phoneme sequences such as /za/ or /sa/, but not /ca/ (see the table in §1.2.1.1). [4] The glottal phoneme could be analyzed as /ʔC/, reducing the total number of phonemes; however, this analysis would assume double onset slots for the word-initial syllable. For example, [ʔmɑ̟] ‘horse’ is /ʔma/ (CCV), which destroys the commonality of syllable structures within a word ( \r \h). We agree with the analysis of /Cˀ/ since it is difficult to propose there is a slot for /ʔ/, since /ʔ/ cannot precede all the consonants. [5] This means there is no consonant in the onset C slot."

For example, ‘5’ is mbja-laɣ-saɳga, which can be given the literal gloss ‘all [of the fingers from] the hand [on one] side’, while ‘6’ is laɣ-saŋga-hjakod ‘hand [on one] side [plus] one’, and so on. ‘10’ is formed from ‘hand’ plus the verb stem ‘finish, run out’, i.e. ‘the hands, finished’. The counting then continues according to the same pattern, but with tagu ‘foot’ instead of ‘hand’, all the way to 20. Today it is clearly becoming obsolete, and some speakers, when showing their counting skills, hesitantly produced forms such as inah-inah-hjakod ‘2+2+1’ for ‘5’, and inah-inah-inah ‘2+2+2’ for ‘6’. Such arithmetic neologisms reflect the fact that reciting numbers in Marind is a rather unnatural exercise, and all speakers clearly prefer to use Malay for this purpose.

September 14, 2012.",,"Traditionally, Nyamal didn't use words for very higher numbers, so the traditional numbers are as above. Nyamal is an endangered language with 20 speakers. Orthographies used The Pilbara languages have adopted either a voiceless ‘ptk’ or voiced ‘bdg’ spelling system based upon orthographies already being used as per community wishes. In all orthographies ‘j’ is used rather than ‘dj’, ‘dy’, ‘tj’ etc.. The name Yindjibarndi may seem to contradict this, but it is the only word in the language that has this spelling (as the community wished to retain the original spelling of the language name). Sometimes a ‘k’ is used in a ‘bdg’ orthography; this occurs when ‘n’ and ‘g’ cross syllable boundaries, otherwise ‘n-g’ could be confused with the sound ‘ng’. The following spelling system (based upon the pronunciation of Standard Australian English) is used for Pilbara languages: Short Vowels a As in the ‘u’ in cut. i As in pin. u As in put. Long Vowels aa Similar to a but held a bit longer. It is about the same as the vowel sound in the English words cart, start and farm. ii Similar to i but held a bit longer. It is about the same as the vowel sound in the English words seek, teeth and pristine. uu Similar to u but held a bit longer. There is no real equivalent in Standard Australian English. Practice by saying the sound in put but holding it longer, as in the word pool. Consonants b/p About halfway between the English sounds b as in the word bill and p as in the word pill. It’s a bit like the sound in spill. Try to listen to the difference between the way you pronounce pill and spill. To Australian English speakers, the p in spill often sounds more like b. d/t About halfway between the English sounds d as in the word dill and t as in the word till. It’s a bit like the sound in still. Try to listen to the difference between the way you pronounce till and still. To Australian English speakers, the t in still often sounds more like d. rd/rt Similar to the English d sound as in had, but made with your tongue tip curled slightly back. This sound is a bit like the American English way of saying herd and yard. g/k About halfway between the English sounds g as in the word gill and k as in the word kill. It’s a bit like the sound in skill. Try to listen to the difference between the way you pronounce kill and skill. To Australian English speakers, the k in skill often sounds more like g. j Similar to the j sound in the English words jam, jump and major, but it is said with most of the front half of your tongue pressed against the top of your mouth. It’s very similar to the sound in dew. l Like English l. lh Made by saying l with the tongue touching the back of the top front teeth.[ rl Similar to the English l sound as in pal, but made with your tongue tip curled backwards. This sound is a bit like the American English way of saying girl and snarl. ly Made by saying l with most of the front half of your tongue pressed flat against the top of your mouth. It is like the sound in the English word million when the word is said quickly. m Like English m. n Like English n. ng Same as the sound at the end of the English word bang and in the middle of singer. In Pilbara languages, this sound can also occur at the start of a word, which can be hard for English speakers to say. You can practise by saying the word singer, getting slower each time. Then try saying the first part, si-, silently so you are just saying -nger out loud. nh Made by saying n with the tongue touching the back of the top front teeth. rn Similar to the English n sound as in pan, but made with your tongue tip curled backwards. This sound is a bit like the American English way of saying barn and earn. ny Made by saying n with most of the front half of your tongue pressed against the top of your mouth. It is like the sound in the English word onion, or in bunyip when it is said quickly. r Similar to the English r sound as in run, pram and red, but made with your tongue tip curled slightly back. rr A trilled r like in Italian or Scottish English. Sometimes this is pronounced as a very short trill or tap, similar to the sound in butter when it is said very quickly. th Made by saying t with the tongue touching the back of the top front teeth. w Like English w. y Like English y."

Kaluli seems to count both sides of the nose and the nose tip, resulting in a maximum of 35. Edolo jumps from the eye to the nose, like Onobasulu, and then apparently counts all the opposite body parts. Ernst (1997) says the following about the Onobasulu counting system: Onabasulu, like many peoples in this region, count up and then down the body (see Ernst 1996). Starting with the little finger of the right hand, they count the fingers, palm, wrist, parts of the arm and neck, cheek, ear, eye and finally the nose (seventeen). The number eighteen is the same word as the number sixteen, but refers to the left rather than the right eye. This applies all down the left side, until the small finger of the left hand is reached, which signifies thirty-three. All the Onobasulu numbers are listed in the above table, which should be read as if looking at a person who is facing the reader. This person's little finger on his right hand is number one. This particular use of bodyparts makes non-verbal indication of numbers easy. It is not unusual, with older people especially, to see someone touch their particular part of the arm, neck or face to answer a question of how many people or things were involved in some action. There is also a word to indicate one full count, fula, which of course strictly taken would mean ‘thirty-three’. However, nowadays this word is also used to refer to one hundred. When numbers are used as modifiers in a Noun phrase to quantify nouns the modifier–ba is attached to the number word. The modifying number follows the noun that it quantifies. Thus we have inolo kabeba 'six men', dofene domoba 'seven pigs', etc. The numbers 'one' to 'five' have deviant forms, shown below. dofene ule 'one pig' dofene aida 'two pigs' dofene osoloa three pigs' dofene biniba 'four pigs' dofene bia 'five pigs' To indicate that the number of objects counted by the modifying numeral is considered to be not very big, the diminutive –deno can be attached to the numeral. SEQ nx 1x230) hilia osolo-a-deno day three-mdfr-dim ‘Only three days’ In their modifying form the number words can function as head of the Noun Phrase and as such occur independently as subject or object of clauses. SEQ nx 2x437) Bia fisa-ba dalu. five.mdfr escape-adj.dep go-pst ‘Five escaped’ SEQ nx 3x247) Na biniba dulu 1sg four.mdfr get-pst ‘I got four (items)' To express that things or persons are dealt with individually, or in pairs of two, or groups of three or more, an adverbial-like construction is formed in which the modifying number in question is repeated and suffixed with the suffix –ba.[6] SEQ nx 4x261) Aida aida-ba dalu two two-mdfr go-pst ‘They went two by two' SEQ nx 5x262) Dabulu-ba dabulu-ba-ba dima ten-mdfr ten-mdfr-mdfr get-imp ‘Take ten at the time’ As for Edolo and Kaluli, Onobasulu is leaving its traditional counting system behind, due to the influence of the decimal based national monetary system and the English language educational system. What we find now is a mix of traditional numbers, English and a system of counting groups of tens. For numbers up till twelve, people will use the Onobasulu words. From thirteen up the English words are used when just counting. When using numerals to indicate how many things or people are involved, people use a system in which the groups of tens and ones are counted as in the following example. SEQ nx 6x436) Inolo dabulu-ba-fia ule man ten-mdfr-seq one.mdfr ‘Eleven men’ 7x246) Dabulu kabe-ba osolo ten six-mdfr three ‘sixty-three’ (lit: 6 (units of) ten, three) [1] For the younger generation it does not seem to matter anymore whether one starts with the left or the right side. [2] Grosh (2000) p. 39. [3] Gossner (1994: 76), states that the base of the counting system is 34, but he does not mention how he gets there. Assumebly the Edolo count both sides of the nose. [4] Ernst (1997: p.15f.). Ernst adheres cultural significance to the Onobasulu number system: ""As the number seventeen (which is also ""nose"" and ""center"") is the only unpaired number in the counting system, it represents singularity, as opposed to the plurality of the paired numbers. It is therefore appropriate to the cosmogonic myth of Duduma, who is killed at the center, a location from which diversity emerges. The ""seventeen clans"" corresponds to an Onabasulu identity in relation to the cosmogonic myth of Duduma, not necessarily empirical extant kinship groups."" In this light it is interesting that the Onobasulu alphabet ended up having 17 letters! [5] Since almost everything can be 'verbed' in Onobasulu, I would be inclined to interpret this suffix –ba to be the same as the adjunct dependent verb form marker –ba. A sentence as (3) would then be interpreted as 'I quadriplifyingly got it'. The event of getting something is quadriplified. [6] Similarly here, the suffix –ba can be interpreted as the adjunct dependent form. The link between this verb form and adverbial notions is a firm one in the language. See section [7] Old people will still use the traditional counting system, although I have not met any pair of old men yet who would agree over which exact body parts are counted between the shoulder and the nose. This might be because of the disconvergence with the Kaluli system."

Tʼapo, Opuuo) [lgn], specifically from the Bilugu dialect of Ethiopia. The ""Original System"" below is used by the older generation who grew up uneducated and the ""New System"" used by the younger educated generation and is promoted in school. The original system clearly uses a base-5 / base-20 system built on the concepts of hand and body. For example, full hand amounts to 5, double hand amounts to 10, the body of one man amounts to 20, the body of two men to 40, and so forth. The concept of body here probably refers to the twenty digits of hands and feet. In the New System, however, speakers have reinterpreted the body concept in a base-10 system. Thus, while still using hand for 5 and double hand for 10, they use the body of two men for 20, the body of three men for 30, and so forth. This is so that the number of bodies being spoken of corresponds with western written numerals 20/30/40/50/60/70/80/90. Note also that the numbers 1 and 6 have contracted forms (shown in the ""alternative"" column), and that any complex number formed using these cardinal numbers may also employ the contraction. Thus, for example, 60 can be the uncontracted form /ɛ̄sɪ́bɪ̀kʰānɪ́ɗjān/ or the contracted form /ɛ̄sɪ́bɪ̀kʰánɗɛ̄/, though only the former is listed in the chart. The element /kʰān/ in numbers 6-9 (and all subsequent complex numbers employing these) is here glossed 'five', but I am unsure of its actual meaning or etymology. It is possibly a greatly reduced form of /kʼʊ̄y-ɪ́n/ 'hand-3n.poss', but so far there is no evidence for this beyond speculation, and native speakers certainly no longer parse it as anything but 'five'. This paper employs the following abbreviations for glosses: asc 'associative' (used to gloss the associative H tone, sometimes found with an epenthetic vowel /-ɪ́/), source 'locative/source marker', 3n.poss 'third person neuter possessive', com 'comitative', sg.m 'singular masculine', pl 'plural', and ord 'ordinalizer'. Finally, note three phonological phenomena occurring in these data. First, the plural participant nominalizing prefix /bɪ̀-/ and ordinalizer prefix /ɪ̄-/ will assimilate a [+ATR] feature before a root with a [+ATR] vowel (e.g. */bɪ̀-mùtʰa̋/ à /bì-mùtʰa̋/). Second, the source prefix /à-/, which lexically bears a L tone, undergoes tonal leveling when occurring between two M tones (e.g. */kʼʊ̄j-à-sʊ̄kʼɛ́n/ à /kʼʊ̄j-ā-sʊ̄kʼɛ́n/). Third, the borrowed lexme /kúr/ 'hundred' takes an alternate stem /kɔ̞́r/ when higher than one-hundred (e.g. /kúr ɗjān/ 'one-hundred', but /kɔ̞́r sʊ̄kʼá/ 'two-hundred'). The ""Original Tʼapo (Opuuo) System"" used by the older generation who grew up uneducated and the ""New System"" used by the younger educated generation. The original system clearly uses a base-5 / base-20 system built on the concepts of ""hand"" and ""body"".

This is so that the number of ""bodies"" being spoken of corresponds with western written numeral 20/30/40/50/60/70/80/90. Note also that the numbers 1 and 6 have contracted forms (shown in the ""alternative"" column), and that any complex number formed using these cardinal numbers may also employ the contraction. Thus, for example, 60 can be the uncontracted /ɛ̄sɪ́bìkānɪ́dʼyān/ or the contracted /ɛ̄sɪ́bìkándʼɛ̄/, though only the former is listed in the chart. This paper employs the following abbreviations for glosses: ASC 'associative' (used to gloss the associative H tone, sometimes found with an epenthetic vowel /-ɪ́/), LOC 'locative/source', 3N.POSS 'third person neuter possessive', COM 'comitative', SG.M 'singular masculine actor prefix', PL 'plural actor prefix', and ORD 'ordinalizer'.",,

Vocabulary notes: 1. The word for 100 is the same word as used for bags. There is likely some historical link between something carried in bags and 100 (coins or weight in pounds/kg), but I have no solid proof of this. 2. The word for 1000 is “sheet of paper” which itself is the same as “wing of bird”. The currency here is CFA, with 1000 being one of the smallest paper bills (currently equivalent to about $2, set exchange with Euro, formerly French Franc, so has remained fairly stable, as in it has probably been one of the smallest paper notes for a long time). I’m not definite on this link, but given that this is an alternative vocabulary item, it seems fairly likely. Of course, more recently the English numerals are replacing the traditional counting system, such as /hundreti/ ‘100’ and /tawsandi/ ‘1000’. Morphology Notes: 1. Just in case you wondered, the series from 31-39 echoes 11-19 in the form of 20+10+1, 20+10+2, 20+10+3, 20+10+4, 20+15, 20+15+1, 20+15+2, 20+15+3, 20+15+4. And just in case you look up Cameroon and notice that it is francophone, don’t assume that they are copying the idea from French 80-99 numbers. The Oroko live in the section of Cameroon that is a former ENGLISH colony. 2. The first word of forty (móˋ) is the same noun as twenty (ɾóˋ), but with a different class marker. Phonologically this breaks down: /ɗi-/ (class 5 - singular) or /ma-/ (class 6 - plural) attaching to the root /óˋ/ (“twenty”) where the vowel of the class marker is deleted. The same is true of one/two hundred (root /kpa/ with class 7 /e/- or 8 /be/- prefix) and also one/two thousand (root /kóɾí/ with class 19 (singular) /i/- or 11 (plural) /ɾo/- prefix). 3. The second word (modifer) of forty (máàbɛ́ / máˋbɛ́) is really the same word as two (béèbɛ́ / béˋbɛ́), being made of the root /ˋbɛ́/ (‘two’) with class 6 (plural) agreement prefix /má/- (to agree with the class of ‘twenty’) or the class 8 (plural) marker /bé/- (default for ordinal counting) respectively. The same is true of the modifiers of thousand, which are the same roots as ‘one’ /ɔ́kɔ́/ and ‘two’ /ˋbɛ́/ except with the appropriate class markers, class 19 (singular) /i/- or 11 (plural) /ɾo/- prefix). 4. The root of ‘one’ is /ɔkɔ/, but when the prefix /i/- is added, a glide /j/ can be heard phonetically between the prefix and root. When the prefix /e/- is added, some dialects have the same /j/ as a glide, while about half the dialects insert /ʧ/, or /e/ becomes /ʧ/ resulting in /eʧɔkɔ/ or /ʧɔkɔ/. This process is generally observed throughout the phonology in the other dialects, but I have not fully analyzed it. Dialect Comments: There are at least 9 distinct Oroko ‘clans’ each with their own dialect, with 4 definite dialect clusters (1-3-1-3) that are approximately equally different from each other and one (forming what I call a ‘dialect circle’ as opposed to a ‘dialect continuum’). The last dialect borders another language and is the most different from everyone, relating more strongly to only 1 cluster. None of the clans or clusters is obviously central, more respected or historically the root of the others. - One of the other 8 Oroko dialects uses 5+3 for ‘8’. About half use a totall separate vocabulary item /wambi/ that may be borrowed from a neighboring language. - Two dialects use 5+4 for ‘9’, others have morphological variants of ‘not 1’. - As for the numbers 10 and above, initial data shows only slight phonetic, phonological or morphological differences. Example: ‘2’ is /bebɛ/, /bebe/, or /beba/ and ‘4’ is /bene/, /benɛi/, /beni/, /bini/ depending on the dialect Oroko phonemic Chart: Consonants Labial Alveolar Laminal 1 Velar Labiovelar Voiceless f t s k kp Voiced b ɾ j w Nasals m n ɲ Prenasals mb nd ɲdʒ ŋɡ ŋmɡb Phonetic Observations: - General observation – with a lack of a stop/fricative distinction at any point of articulation, the consonants (more so in the front of the mouth) all have a bit of variation in the amount/strength of closure, so that sometimes the air is incompletely “stopped”, while not a prototypical fricative. o /f/ varies between /f/ and a fricative /p/ o /R/ varies between /d/, /l/ and /r/, tending to be ‘stronger’ (more like /d/) word initially, before hi vowels and less so morpheme initially. o /b/ also is ‘stronger’ word-initially, and ‘weaker’ (resembling a /w/ or fricative /b/) word-medially. - Oroko has a 7-vowel Bantu system, with ATR distinctions in the mid-vowels: /i/, /e/, /ɛ/, /a/, /ɔ/, /o/, /u/ - Oroko has two tones, high and low, with downstep (indicated in the transcription as a floating low tone). The downstep is approximately 1/3 below the high tone as compared to the low tone. Downstep is only found at morpheme boundaries (most exceptions can be attributed to borrowed words). Theoretically, this indicates a deleted vowel - either historically (such as the disappearance of a final syllable), or morphologically (Oroko prefers a CV syllable template, and often deletes vowels at morpheme boundaries). The two forms given for ‘two’ béèbɛ́ / béˋbɛ́ illustrate either the lengthening of the prefix vowel to carry the low tone, or the floating tone resulting in a downstep. - The most predominant tone process is for high tones to spread one syllable to the right. This does not happen phrase finally (such as words in isolation), or when the following low tone is in turn followed by a high tone. For example ‘15’ (no spread – phrase final) vs. ‘16’ (high tone on second syllable spreads to final syllable of first word) and ‘11’ (high tone spread from last syllable of first word to second word ‘and’ since the syllable following /na/ is also low) vs. ‘12’ (no spread to /nà/ since the word following is once again high) ---------------------------- [1] As this column has a mixture of alveopalatal and palatal phonemes, I have decided to use the less precise phonetic description “laminal” (Kenstowicz 1994:30) to group all the phonemes made with the tongue-blade, as the traditional phonemic features are all too specific for Mbonge."

Or ''one hand and two''. Number 15 can be expressed by either ''inɡeni heriso nei vahai'', literally means ''hands two and one (foot)'' or ''inɡeni nei eto utu vahai'', 'hands two and foot one', but more commonly, people say ''inɡeni heriso nei vahai''. 20 can be expressed by either ''inɡeni heriso nei to utu heriso'', literallyː 'hands two and feet two' or ''inɡeni nei heriso eto utu heriso''.

The numbers ''hundred'' and ''thousand'' are loanwords from Austronesian language. Pagu has counting numbers from 1 up to 999,999. One million is not mentioned as Pagu number, probably as it refers back to money counting in the old period where millions are ‘unfamiliar’ number. Pagu people know millions just recently in the counting money case, namely those borrowed from the Indonesian/Malay juta ‘million’ It has some the basic numbers: (i) single numbers (1 to 9), (ii) tens (10 to 99), (iii) hundreds (100 to 999), and (v) thousand (1000 to 999,999). These are the numbers and the system for their combinations. (the stress is always on the penultimate syllable) Single numbers: 0: koiwa 1: (du)moi 2: modidi 3: moange 4: loata 5: motoa 6: butanga 7: tumudiing 8: tuange 9: siwo Tens: 10: mogioko 20: monaloko 30: moluange 40: moluata 50: molitoa 60: molibutanga 70: molitumudiing 80: molituange 90: molisiwo The tens can be followed by single numbers connected with the conjunction de ‘and’, as shown in the following examples: 11: mogioko de dumoi 12: mogioko de modidi 55: molitoa de motoa 93: molisiwo de moange 99: molisiwo de siwo Etc. Hundreds Hundreds are always preceded by ‘hundred’, followed by ‘ten’ and then a single number. The hundred is followed by a single number (not linked with de) that identify the amount of the ‘hundred’. It is then followed by ‘ten’ that is linked with de and followed by a single number that linked by de again. 101: latusu moi de dumoi 345: latusu moange de moluata de motoa 589: latusu motoa de molituange de siwo 834: latusu tuange de moluange de loata 999: latusu siwo de molisiwo de siwo Etc. Thousands Thousands are always preceded by ‘thousand’ followed by ‘hundred’, ‘ten’ and then a single number. The ‘thousand’ is followed by some number (not linked with de) that identify the amount of the thousand. The thousand and the hundred is linked with de. The ‘hundred’ is followed by a single number and not linked with de too. The ‘ten’ is followed with a single number linked with the. See the following examples. 3,021: ribusu moange de monaloko de dumoi 65,605: ribusu de molibutanga de motoa de latusu butanga de motoa 999,999: ribusu de latusu siwo de molisiwo de siwo de latusu siwo de molisiwo de siwo Etc. Note that in Pagu often there is a 'copy vowel' (when the last sound of a word is a consonant). Like in the numerals: loat 'four' is pronounced loata, mogiok 'ten' --> mogioko, monalok '20' --> monaloko, and moluat '40' --> moluata.This copy vowel is however not counted as a syllable, thus the stress would be: 'loat(a) (is correct already), mo'giok(o), mo'nalok(o) and mo'luat(a)."

The numeral twenty is pina madikwa, 'two tens', forty is paxnika madikwa, 'four tens', etc. For numerals higher than 100, numeral terms from the trade language, the French creole dialect, are used a great deal more than those of Palikur. Palikur is an extremely agglutinative language, morphophonemic changes are extremely complicated and vowel harmony is common. That is why the combination of paha 'one' and u-waku 'our-hand' makes the compound word pohowku 'five'. The numerals eight and nine are based on the term for numeral seven, ntewnehker, so eight is ntewnehker akak pahat arawna, 'seven with one added'. All numerals occur with one of twenty-three affixes that classify the items being counted.

Below is the additional information by Ms. Shirley Chapman (2008): I have added to the one I previously did so that you can see the alterations. All numeral can be marked for the ka-noun class. I don't have written data to show for four but I reckon that /-ko-/ when a ka- prefix is added(-ka-ko-) > -ako- so that would probably make the words. aako'bamahakhamaki/ avaako'bamahakhamaki. The ka- prefix together with the -khama suffix are the normal affixation for reciprocal. The reciprocal ka- has no meaning relationship with the ka- noun class. The one hand ""5"" and two hands ""10"" are usually followed by hi- which is one of the verbs ""to be"". Hand is a ka-noun class word so it would usually be sa'ai kahoarani kihiki ""to be five"" and sa'ai ko'bamiki kihiki ""to be 10"".

Until recently Paunaka and its possibly close relative Paikoneka were classified extinct by linguists, however, approximately ten speakers and semi-speakers still live in the communities surrounding Concepción de Chiquitos and in the TCO Lomerío. All speakers are trilingual with Spanish and Bésɨro (or Chiquitano), which are the dominant languages of the region. No grammar of Paunaka has been published until now, and ethnographic data is scarce. In this project we collect and transcribe roughly 50 hours of data, partly in Paunaka and partly in Spanish, which will be stored in the Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR). The linguistic part of the project focuses on a description of the Paunaka language, as well as its relation to Paikoneka and other Arawakan languages. The ethnographic part seeks to clarify what factors constitute a Paunaka identity among the Chiquitano. There is only one traditional number 'one' tʃɨ.na.tʃɨ kept in Paunaka. Numbers 8, 10, 12, and 20 also occurred in my data, all of them without the suffix -tʃɨ. Anyway, as they only occurred in contexts that are highly associated with Spanish (like counting months, money etc.) and where often surrounded by more loans/codes witching, the data is probably not so reliable, and I decided to exclude the numerals from the list. The tables below list the phonemes of Paunaka, but not their allophones. I only have the information about the phones in a tex-file at the moment, and not in a chart either."

(ds=different subject; ipst=immediate past) Even the form βaʧatak ‘one’ is complex; it is βaʧatak in isolation, but shows up as βaʧa when used attributively—for example: βaʧa ɣusi ‘one section’. The (apparent) suffix –tak doesn’t show up elsewhere in the grammar. The forms for 2 and 3 have the suffix –kay, which is used for locatives and instrumentals; this suffix is lost when the numerals are used attributively, just like –tak for ‘one’: añɨŋuta ɣusi ‘three sections’. The word for three appears to have the same root as the word for two, plus the element –uta, which doesn’t show up elsewhere. But since it strongly resembles the plural suffix –ura, which goes on verbs, I’ve glossed it ‘plural?’ here. ‘Four’ is realized as two twos. None of the numbers from five upwards have fixed forms; they are all expressed with the concept of finishing one hand and crossing over to the other, or finishing both and going down to the feet, but that concept can be expressed however you want. So for example, the difference between 7 and 8 in the chart above, where 7 is expressed as ‘one arm, other side…’ and 8 as ‘cross to the other side and…’, is not meaningful—either form could have shown up in the other format."

Some speakers insist that the only authentic numbers are the first three cardinal numbers; the rest has been made up by the local educational authorities. In general, numerals bigger than ‘three’ do not occur in natural discourse. Instead, Spanish loans are used, especially, when referring to money. In the past, as speakers point out, quantifiers such as osheki ‘many’ and pashini ‘[some] others’ were used for numbers above ‘three’. Some brief explanations of the etymology of numerals: 4 apiteta or apite(ka)vakaye 'four'is derived from apite 'two' and the meaning of the numeral is 'twice two' according to language consultants 5 apapakoroni 'five' is derived from the truncated root apa 'one' and ako 'hand' the composite meaning of 'five' is 'one hand' 6 oiha is the verb root 'to follow' shint(s)a is the verb root 'be/string together' 7 shirink-ap-aincha-ri is a nominalization derived from the verb root shirink 'ecrease' 8 ocho is a loan from Spanish; pasini is an adjective 'other' Numerals elicited from the speaker from San Miguel are not autochthonous to the Perené area; these are numerals from the adjacent Ashaninka variety; of the variety spoken along the rivers Ene-Tambo.

It is geographically and linguistically included in the Gallo-Italic languages group of Northern Italy (with Lombard, Emiliano-Romagnolo and Ligurian). It is part of the wider western group of Romance languages, which also includes French, Occitan, and Catalan. It is spoken in Piedmont (except est on Sesia river in the eastern part), Liguria (northwest part near Savona) and Lombardy (a very small part in Lomellina in the Pavia province). Many European and North American linguists acknowledge Piedmontese as an independent language, though in Italy it is often still considered a dialect. Today it has a certain official status recognized by the Piedmont regional government, but not by the national government."

The Pirahã live along the Maici River, a tributary of the Amazon River. There are no the concept of numbers or numerals in the Pirahã language. The word hói was universally used to describe one object, hoí was used to describe two or more objects, and baáɡiso was used to refer to quantities of three or more. These data were consistent with meanings of ''one'', ''roughly two'' and ''many''. However, in the decreasing elicitation, hói was used to refer to quantities as large as six, hoí was used for quantities between four and ten, and baáɡiso was used for quantities between seven and ten. None of the three words that Pirahã produced were used consistently to refer to any particular quantity across the two tasks. Because each of the three words was used a dramatically different range of values in the ascending thank the descending elicitations, they are much more likely to be relative or comparative terms like ''few'' than absolute terms like ''one''. Below is taken from Wikipedia about Pirahã language. According to Everett in 1986, Pirahã has words for 'one' (hói) and 'two' (hoí), distinguished only by tone. In his 2005 analysis, however, Everett claimed that Pirahã has no words for numerals at all, and that hói and hoí actually mean ""small quantity"" and ""larger quantity"". Frank et al. (2008) describes two experiments on four Pirahã speakers that were designed to test these two hypotheses. In one, ten batteries were placed one on a table one at a time and the Pirahã were asked how many were there. All four speakers answered in accordance with the hypothesis that the language has words for 'one' and 'two' in this experiment, uniformly using hói for one battery, hoí for two batteries, and a mixture of the second word and 'many' for more than two batteries. The second experiment, however, started with ten batteries on the table, and batteries were subtracted one at a time. In this experiment, one speaker used hói (the word previously supposed to mean 'one') when there were six batteries left, and all four speakers used that word consistently when there were as many as three batteries left. Though Frank and his colleagues do not attempt to explain their subjects' difference in behavior in these two experiments, they conclude that the two words under investigation ""are much more likely to be relative or comparative terms like 'few' or 'fewer' than absolute terms like 'one' "". Pirahã Phonology ( Taken from Wikipedia ) The Pirahã language is one of the phonologically simplest languages known, claimed to have as few as ten phonemes (one fewer than Rotokas). This requires analysing [k] as an underlying /hi/. Although odd cross-linguistically, Ian Maddieson has found in researching Pirahã data that /k/ indeed has an unusual distribution. The 'ten phoneme' claim also does not consider the tones of Pirahã, at least two of which are phonemic (marked by an acute accent and either unmarked or marked by a grave accent in Everett), bringing the number of phonemes to at least twelve. Sheldon (1988) claims three tones, high (¹), mid (²) and low (³). Phoneme inventory When languages have inventories as small and allophonic variation as great as in Pirahã and Rotokas, different linguists may have very different ideas as to the nature of their phonological systems. Consonant Chart ( The segmental phoneme ) Bilabial Alveolar Velar Glottal Stops p, b t (k), ɡ ʔ(written""x"") Fricative s h [k] has been claimed to be an optional portmanteau of /hi/.

In this way, the complete opposed hand works like a milestone since the speaker counts each quantity. This is my interpretation; then it is not a simple additive designation, but an advanced or forewarned construction. Of course, it is opaque to the speakers. 10 is built by two ways: dáp-at-kau //hand-ablative/completive-two// ""from the second hand"", or kâu-mo-dáp //two-someone-hand// ""the second hand of someone"". 20 is ""one person"", 40 ""two person"". Numbers between 11 to 19 add the word for ""foot"", in a similar way that 6-9 numbers. But I said these designations are grammatical constructions that nobody uses. Puinave is sometimes linked specifically with Makú, as Puinave-Maku, and sometimes connected to the Arutani-Sape languages in a Kalianan branch."

Dvrù dialect of Rvwàng, Konglang and Sangnay clans. Originally spoken on the upper Rvmetì (N'mai Hka) river north of Konglangpø and also in Nokmong, Putao District, Kachin State, Myanmar. Data provided by Konglang Zineng in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The phonology of this dialect has not been fully analyzed yet. In general, however, this dialect has a similar phonemic system to Mvtwàng Rvwàng (R. Morse 1962/1963; S. Morse 1988, 1989) and Rvmø̀l Rvwàng (Straub 2016). There are three tones on syllables that do not have stop finals, based on a scale of 5 (highest) to 1 (lowest): High/rising á 35, Mid a 22~221, Low/falling à 42~31. Tone on syllables with final p/t/k or ʔ (the latter considered a tone-register complex) is non-distinctive, usually realized as high or high falling. Tone on minor syllables (Cə) is non-distinctive as well. Occasionally a distinct 55 tone will appear on certain particles, or a low-rising 24~34 tone, often associated with first person verb conjugations. Also, vowel length is distinctive for marking grammatical meaning changes, and when the vowel of a stop-final syllable is lengthened, its tone usually becomes mid-rising 24. Vowels: i, e [e~ɛ], a, u, o [o~ɔ], ə, ɨ. Initial consonants: p, b, t, d, k, g, s, z [dz], ts, tʃ, dʒ, m, n, ɲ, ŋ, h [h~x], j, l, r [ɹ~r~ɾ]. Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, r, j. The diphthongs aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj and the initial clusters ml, pl, bl, kl, ɡl, pr, br, kr, ɡr, kw, ɡw, hw have been observed. In certain words, aj is followed by a glottal stop (ajʔ), lending strength to the analysis of ʔ as a tone-register complex. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Glottal stop elision: In citation form, 'one' is tiʔ. However, when combined with a following syllable, it loses the glottal stop, as in tisə́n 'ten'. (2) The historical final lateral consonant *l is realized as n as in ti-sə́n < *tiʔ-sə́l 'ten'.

Diphthongs include /aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj/. /ɨj/ is usually realized with a slightly longer vowel: [ɨˑj]; /aj/ may be considered an inherently-long-vowel counterpart to /əj/. Clusters observed include: /bl, pr, br, kr, gr/. The cluster /mj/ is found in Burmese loanwords, and the cluster /dw/ in Jinghpaw loanwords. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Palatalization: The initial consonant /n/ becomes /ɲ/ when followed by the vowel /i/, e.g. əní sə́l→əɲí sə́l 'twenty'. Although this nasal palatalization is a regular process, the palatal nasal forms are given in the transcription here without abstracting them to their original alveolar nasal form /n/. The palatal nasal consonant also appears before other vowels, such as /a/ in /ɲaʔù/ 'to swallow', so it can definitely be considered a separate phoneme in the latter environment. (2) Reduction to affricates: The numeral 4 is rendered /əblì/ in Dvrù and /əbrì/ in Mvpang Dvngsar, but in this dialect the *b{l,r} cluster is reduced to the affricate /dʒ/ as /ədʒì/.

Voiceless stops and affricates are aspirated, although this is not indicated in the transcription for brevity's sake. Final consonants: p, t, k, m, n, ŋ, l, r, j. Diphthongs include /aj, əj, ɨj, uj, oj/. /ɨj/ is usually realized with a slightly longer vowel: [ɨˑj]; /aj/ may be considered an inherently-long-vowel counterpart to /əj/. Clusters observed include: /bl, pr, br, kr, gr/. The cluster /mj/ is found in Burmese loanwords, and the cluster /dw/ in Jinghpaw loanwords. In terms of phonological processes, two are observable here: (1) Palatalization: The initial consonant /n/ becomes /ɲ/ when followed by the vowel /i/, e.g. əní sə́l→əɲí sə́l 'twenty'. Although this nasal palatalization is a regular process, the palatal nasal forms are given in the transcription here without abstracting them to their original alveolar nasal form /n/. The palatal nasal consonant also appears before other vowels, such as /a/ in /ɲaʔù/ 'to swallow', so it can definitely be considered a separate phoneme in the latter environment. (2) Reduction to affricates: The numeral 4 is rendered /əblì/ in Dvrù and /əbrì/ in Mvpang Dvngsar, but in this dialect the *b{l,r} cluster is reduced to the affricate /dʒ/ as /ədʒì/.

I refer you to that chapter for an explanation of the allophones of the phonemes. In particular, note the following four points: i) The vowel transcribed as “u” is a high, back, spread vowel, as is usually transcribed with the symbol used for IPA vowel 16 (an inverted “m” symbol). ii) Note the comments on the inclusion or absence in transcriptions of the glottal stop, on pages 13 and 95 of my thesis. iii) An accent symbol shows a high tone, not stress. Its absence indicates low tone. iv) Long vowels are indicated by a doubling of the symbol for the vowel in question. 2. Grammatical Numerals and many other words (for instance, adjectives) have suffixes in Resígaro that are determined by the nature and shape of the object(s) designated or referred to. These suffixes are described in my thesis in Part II, chapter 3, starting on page 152. The “basic” forms of the numerals, given above, use the “finger” and “man” classifier suffixes; the actual form in any given utterance will depend on the object(s) referred to.

Referenceː Chia-jung Pan. A Grammar of Lha'alua, an Austronesian Language of Taiwan. Doctorial thesis submitted to the School of Arts and Social Sciences, James Cook University, Australia. March, 2012.",,"Lha’alua (known as Saaroa), an Austronesian language of Taiwan. Lha’alua is spoken in Taoyuan Village and Kaochung Village, Taoyuan District, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan. There are approximately 400 people of Lha’alua. At the moment, 10-15 people are able to speak the language. The language status of Lha’alua is moribund. Most Formosan languages, Lha’alua (Saaroa) language has three distinctions from 1 to 10 (serial counting, human, and non-human), and two distinctions above 11 (human and non-human). Notes: 1. Serial counting numerals from one to ten are based on the numeral forms (i.e. roots) of nonhuman and human numerals. Numerals from ‘one’ to ‘four’ are formed by vowel lengthening. Numerals from ‘five’ to ‘ten’ are formed by prefixing ku- to the numeral bound root. For the numeral ‘six’, ku- undergoes vowel harmony and becomes ke- in that the following syllables contain the high central unrounded vowel [i], transcribed as e. Nonhuman numerals from one to ten begin with the initial u. For ‘six’, u undergoes vowel harmony and becomes e because the following syllables consist of the high central unrounded vowel [i], transcribed as e. It is difficult to make a decision that the initial u is a nonhuman prefix (i.e. u-) which is added to the numeral root (e.g. ucani ‘one’ as u-cani). The reason can be attributed by the fact that numerals from ten to ninety, numerals from one hundred to nine hundred, numerals from one thousand to nine thousand, and numerals higher than ten thousand all consist of the nonhuman numerals from one to ten as base to derive human numerals. In human numerals, ‘one’, ‘two’, ‘three’, ‘four’, ‘five’, ‘six’, ‘seven’, ‘nine’ and ‘how much/how many’ are formed by (C)a- reduplication. a- reduplication applies when the numeral root is vowel-initial. ‘Eight’ is formed by Ca- triplication. Ca 2. Numerals higher than ten: Knowledge of higher numerals is regarded as a token of expertise in the language. At present, old and fluent speakers tend to use Japanese numerals in everyday life, whereas young and non-fluent speakers employ Mandarin Chinese numerals instead. In Lha’alua, the distinction between serial counting and nonhuman numerals is neutralised in numerals higher than ten. 3. Numerals from ten to nineteen: Lha’alua has two distinctions above 11 (human and non-human)ː numerals from 11 to 19 are formed by addition, namely 10+1, 10+2, etc. Numerals from 11 to 19 can be differentiated in terms of their reference to nonhuman or human participants. When expressing nonhuman numerals from 11 to 19, the nonhuman prefix lailha- ‘TENS-’ is added to the numeral root from 1 to 9."

The numeral ‘three’ is the result of concatenation of amulu and bala. All numerals are predicative forms. Since there are no verbs referring to possession, Sabanê expresses possession by means of existential constructions. The numeral ‘three’ is obtained by concatenating kata and bala. The morphemes ano and wola/wolata are used to express plurality, meaning ‘much/many/a lot’, whereas the litotic construction ano–n–mina expresses ‘few/some’. In the sentences, ano is a quantifier, while wola(ta) is an adverb. Sabanês is a tonal language."

The list above contains the number words which are still commonly considered to be “true Safaliba” and not borrowed, and are still in current use among speakers age 40+ and some of the younger generation depending on individual factors. Some younger speakers who do not use the Gonja words, use the above list but substitute /pee/ ‘ten’ for /kporigo/ (which is obviously an ‘older’ word for ‘ten’) when the words is used in combination with ‘toko’ for the numbers between 20 and 100. Finally, a few additional different words have been reported for some of the smaller numbers (<10), but these are only known by some of the very elderly (age 65+) and are not in current usage. Safaliba has two tones (High and Low), which have both lexical and grammatical functions. Automatic downstep causes high tones following low tones to have a lower pitch than the previous high tone. Sometimes a lowered high tone occurs following a high tone—this is marked by the down-step symbol (IPA [́] as in the word ànáásí 'four', above), but since its pitch is lowered to exactly the same degree as a ordinary high tone with automatic downstep, such tones are analyzed as “downstepped high tones” and not a third (“mid”) tone. There are additional reasons based on tonal processes in the phonology which also support this analysis, unfortunately they cannot be described in this short summary."

After five they just said, “many” But this year the elementary school teacher decided to make up numbers that were more official. So for 6 through 9 they use shapes that look like those numbers. For example the tail of a tree kangaroo looks like a 6. A traditional ax looks like a 7. A drum looks like a 8, and a type of eatable grass looks like a 9. Then for the rest of the numbers they just put the smaller numbers together.

Smith, The University of Technology, Lae, Papua New Guinea / University of Hong Kong. December 12, 1988.",very unusual,"Sakam has a very unusual counting system which. although it is essentially a digit-tally one, incorporates the tallying of both nostrils so that 22 rather than 20 tally-points are employed. The system has a basic numeral set (1, 2, 3); 4 has a '2+2' construction. The numbers word for 5 is 'kaibue kuwoku', i.e, 'hand side'. Tallying then proceeds onto the fingers of the other hand until 10, 'hand side hand side', is reached. At this point the fingers are clenched into a fist with the thumbs pointing upward. The left thumb is then placed on the left nostril at a tally of 11, 'tailma kuwe' meaning 'nose one'; the right thumb is placed on the right nostril at a tally of 12, 'tailma dangge', i.e. 'nose two'. Tallying then proceeds onto the toes. At 17 the toes of one foot have been tallied and we have 'koljang kuwoku komen, i.e. 'leg side finished'. One man' cycle is completed at 22 with 'koljang kumen', i.e. 'legs finished'. Except for this irregularity of tallying the nostrils at 11 and 12 which produces an over-all cycle of 22, the sub-cycles are nevertheless 2' (the modified 2-cycle) and 5. This tally system is not at all like the body-part tally systems encountered in other parts of PNG which, for example, do not employ the toes or any tally points on the lower part of the body. Nor are the nostrils tallied; the nose, however, is often tallied at the mid-point of cycle. It may be that the system is, in fact, just a modified digit-tally system which enables a tally up to 12 to be carried out without resorting to the use of toes. This may possibly arise if the tally system also functions as a calendrical device."

Only very few speakers know Huave words for numerals past ‘4’; Spanish numerals are widely used, and there is no separate Huave set of ordinals. The words for 1-3 in the five numeral classes are shown below. The A group is used to count people, animals with four legs, and some objects. The B group is a default, used for most objects, birds, and abstract things like days. The C group is used for long, thin objects such as hammocks, snakes, and sticks. The D group is the sequence that is used to count years, e.g. anom ?iat ‘one year’. Lastly, the E group is used with the Spanish loan vuelt to count how many times something has happened, e.g. ajmbaw vuelt ‘two times’. (Another Spanish loan for counting ‘how many times’, viaje, takes the numbers of the B group.) In all the series except D (which is a hybrid of B and E), the number ‘two’ is formed with aj- + the final consonant of the same series’s word for ‘one’ + a suffix -Vw (which shows up in multiple places elsewhere in the language as a plural marker (e.g. in the determiner ka-w), and may also be considered as such here). For series E, it is relevant to note that prenasalized stops reduce to nasals word-finally, so the m/mb alternation, being phonologically regular, is consistent with this generalization. Basic numerals A B C D E 1 anop anek anots anom anom 2 ajpaw ajkiaw ajtsaw ajkiaw ajmbaw 3 arujpaw aruj aruj aruj arujmbaw The rest of the numerals through 10 are: apokiuf (4), akokiaf (5), anajoyuf (6), ajayuf (7), anoyuf (8), apekaf (9), and akapaf (10). These words all end in -Vf, a plural suffix (identical to the third-person plural). One speaker remembers a word for ‘20’, ñimiow.

Transcriptions cannot be give in IPA as the language is extinct and there are no recordings. The transcriptions of Sarnelli are kept. At the time, it was customary for Italian scholars to leave out Arabic loanwords in their Berber wordlists. The gap of 4-9 almost certainly indicates that those numerals were Arabic. The reason why 10,12,17,19 and 30 are attested, is because Sarnelli was able to elicit the cryptic numerals, which intentionally avoid Arabic numerals so Berber speakers can talk about prices on the marketplace without being understood. Similar cryptic numeral systems are found in el-Foqaha Siwa and probably Awjila. 10 translates to ‘hands’ 12 translates to ‘two hands and two fingers’ 17 translates to ‘three hands and two of fingers’ 19 translates to ‘hands and feet without finger’ 30 translate to ‘month’. Surprisingly ‘two hundred’ is in Sarnelli’s wordlist, which has the archaic Berber word for ‘hundred’ in the plural, but ‘one hundred’ is unattested, which probably means his informant gave him the Arabic numeral."

When I tried to do that, it transformed the ṹ into a copy of the preceding consonant. In other words, when I typed ""kōnũ̀kṹwê"" it gave me ""kōnũ̀kkwê"". I don't know why it did this; I've never seen anything like it before. When I highlighted some letters, I obtained the correct form. So the highlighting isn't there to signal anything, just to ensure that the proper form shows. 2) For the number 1, there are two forms. When counting in the abstract, you use ɑ̀ɖé. So ""one, two, three, four..."" would be ɑ̀ɖé, òwê, ɑ̀tɔ̃̂, ɛ̀nɛ̃̂... But if you want to count actual items, for instance ""one car"" or ""one mango"", you'd use ɖókpó. 3) I can give you morpheme-by-morpheme breakdowns of the longer numbers if you want. For example, 27 is ""20 5 and 2"". 4) I'm not sure that there's a good word for 1000. Traditional counting doesn't go that high. It took my language assistant a while to come up with kótókṹ, so that may not be a very authentic Saxwe word.

Numerals for higher numbers, as well as ‘zero’, are Malay loans with phonological adaptations. Notesː 1. My transcription differ from that of Diffloth and Phillips in that I have not included epenthesis vowels. Specifically, this excludes the following vowels in my analysis of the phonology: [ə] in: /ʔmpat/ [ʔəmpat]; /smilaːn/ [səmilaːn]; /spuloh/ [səpuloh]; /sblaːs/ [səblaːs]; /sratoːs/ [səratoːs]; /sribuːʔ/ [səribuːʔ] [u] in: /dwɨːʔ/ [duwɨːʔ] 2. Occasionally, in surface realisations, the final /ʔ/ in the Malay loanword /dwɨːʔ/ 'two' is dropped; i.e., /dwɨːʔ/ → [duwɨː]. This violates the phonotactic rules which state that only heavy (or closed) syllables can occur in word-final positions. (cf. Diffloth 1976, 1977). However, I have chosen to include the final glottal in the table above, as final consonant deletion is not a regular pattern, and the underlying form is analysed to include the final consonant. Dropping of final consonant is only observed in this numeral. 3. The numeral /nanəʔ/ ‘one’ is often shortened to the prefix form /nu-/. Prefixation of other numerals is not recorded. 4. Nouns preceded by a numeral are typically unitised. 5. NB! The use of the Malay term /kusuŋ/ with the meaning 'zero' is rare. More often, it is used with the meaning 'empty' or 'nothing'.

Unlike the Sartang dialects, the Sherdukpen dialects use the ablative case marker /-lo/ only in numerals 21 and higher, with simplification in numbers 11-19 through loss of this suffix (infix). Syllable-final alternation between velar plosive /k/ and (alveolo-)dental plosive /t/ common; nasal vowels appear to be the result of loss relatively recent loss of syllable-final nasal stops, alternation between nasalized vowel and nasal stop and nasal vowel can still be observed, speakers do not commonly perceive a distinction between the two, and nasalized vowels might not be distinctive. Whereas the older generation still uses the palatalized velar initial /gj/, in the younger generation this is affricated to /j/ [d͡ʒ].

Updated data transcribed by Mr. Brian Buuck, 1 October, 2008, SIL International.",vigesimal,"Sochiapam Chinantec has a vigesimal system. Data transcribed by Brian Buuckː Like Sochiapan, this is not a language I'm really familiar with, less so than with Sochiapan, so you'll need to take the following with a grain of salt. From my interaction with my colleagues (Dr. Foris and Jim Rupp), I think it is safe to say that I am a lot more particular about actual phone pronunciation, and I believe that a lot of their symbols (particularly vowel symbols) are not very accurate from a phonetic standpoint. These are my assumptions regarding the vowels: Only unrounded vowels have palatalized forms. From looking at the Lealao dictionary at my disposal, it appears that the /o/ phoneme corresponds to the open back unrounded vowel in Jocotepec. And the /a/ phoneme corresponds to the /o/ phoneme. That would mean that /o/ is actually, underlyingly, an unrounded vowel, and /a/ is underlyingly a rounded vowel! That would seem a lot more bizarre if I was not aware of a similar tendency to a lesser extent in Lalana Chinantec (a dialect of the same language that Jocotepec belongs to). It appears that the stops correspond to those of Jocotepec. However, palatalization changes the voiceless velar stop ('k') to the voiceless palatal affricate. The voiced affricates (palatalized and non-palatalized versions) are like with Jocotepec as well – it may well be that they come from the missing voiced sibilant originally. The /f/ phoneme comes from /hw/. The /h/ can form syllable-initial consonant clusters with any approximant, any nasal (those are the voiceless nasal plus voiced nasal combinations listed), and with /l/. The same goes for Jocotepec, possibly for Sochiapan. Apparently, in Lealao, the /hw/ is pronounced as 'f'. While in Jocotepec, the glottal stop can form clusters with the same phones, this is apparently not permitted in Lealao (compare the number ""three"" between Lealao and Jocotepec), so the glottal stop has simply been dropped. The /v/ corresponds to the /w/ of Jocotepec, while the other symbols appear to have one-to-one correspondence."

Mr. Brian Buuck, SIL International, October 1, 2008.",vigesimal,"Sochiapam Chinantec has a vigesimal system. Data transcribed by Brian Buuckː Since this is not a language I'm intimately familiar with, I cannot be certain regarding the following, but here is what I suspect: With regard to voiceless stops, there is one-to-one correspondence between Jocotepec and Sochiapan. However, the voiced stops of Jocotepec are voiced fricatives in Sochiapan. The voiced affricate of Jocotepec is voiced in Sochiapan. The Sochiapan consonant phones in parentheses are restricted to loan words (with two exceptions, one involving an expletive, the other involving onomatopoeia). Jocotepec voiceless fricatives and glottal phones correspond one-to-one. The slightly retroflexed, voiced fricative of Sochiapan (based on the two lexical examples given in Dr. Foris' PhD dissertation, correspond to the flap 'r' phoneme in Jocotepec. The nasals correspond one-to-one. The approximants act somewhat differently. Sochiapan can have an approximant preceding a vowel, following a vowel, or both. By the way, Jocotepec only has two phonemic approximants, and they only precede the vowel – all approximants following the vowel, both in Jocotepec as well as in the related dialects, are phonologically motivated by their environments or are consistent allophones. Some research would be required to determine to what extent the complex syllable structure (Dr. Foris refers to the approximants as pre-nuclear and post-nuclear vowels) can be simplified away via allophones and phonologically-motivated processes. I suspect that it can. Jocotepec has a velarized and non-velarized lateral, depending on whether it precedes an anterior or posterior vowel – this corresponds to the two laterals of Sochiapan (which also has other phone pairs that function this way). The vowels are a little more similar with the two languages, and – again – I can make some educated guesses. There is apparently no equivalent in Sochiapan of the front close rounded vowel in Jocotepec (palatalized 'u') – apparently, the 'u' does not front. The front 'a' is the palatalized version of the back open unrounded vowel. Based on what I know of Jocotepec, I suspect that the [a] phoneme (which Dr. Foris refers to as a ""central"" vowel) does not really exist, but derives from the [o] phoneme. So, really, I suspect that at the phonemic level there is only a binary system of vowels with three distinctions: open/close, unrounded/rounded and front/back (i.e. palatalized/non-palatalized). The open back unrounded vowel (in the middle of the vowel chart) occurs rarely in Sochiapan. It's not that common in Jocotepec either, but that's largely because the vowel often undergoes palatalization and other processes."

Most people do not know numbering beyond five and so much of the numerical system is hypothetical based on what people speculate that it should be. I have tried to add in an explanation of what is being said for the cases that differ. As I noted in the attached paper, numerical data beyond the number five is subject to change because people rarely count above 5 using their language and after 8 years of working and living with the people I've discovered that they do not think numerically. If you were to ask someone how many children they have, they would have to name each one and count on their fingers as they think of their children by name, not number. Even in the same conversation, 2 minutes later, if asked to verify that they had 5 children, they would need to start counting all over again. This is the same for number of gardens, pigs, cattle, chickens. People that come to do population or agricultural census find it maddening because if they ask people 5 times to say how many chickens they have, they will often get 5 different answers. This past year the local translators and I tried to confirm the numbering system in the two languages for our own use. So what I've attached is what we are currently using after some research and testing. 21 is expressed by ' one man and one more' and 30 is 'one man and two hands two'.

However, e tahi ʔau and e tahi mano have now the same meaning as in North Marquesan, i.e. e tahi ʔau is ‘400’ and e tahi mano is ‘4000’. ʔau and mano do not occur on their own, but are constructed with the numeral construction e tahi ‘one’ and therefore seem to be more like other collective nominals in the language. Again e tahi ʔau and e tahi mano are only used in specific contexts (the same as in North Marquesan). Otherwise the new forms which are based on the decimal system are preferred and normally used. The same holds for 30, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90.

The vowels are pronounced like the vowels in Portuguese and not like they are in English. The only vowel that is different from the Portuguese is the letter ‘u’. It is the i with the line through it which is the voiced high close central unrounded vocoid. (It is like the u without the rounded lips.) The consonants that are written like the Portuguese sounds are: ‘x’ which is like the ‘sh’ (as in show) in English and the ‘tx’ which is like the ‘ch’ (as in church) in English. There are some final consonants that are not released, such as ‘b’ (pronounced like ‘p’) and ‘d’ (pronounced like ‘t’ ). There are some tonal differences in some words, but they don’t need to write it because the context gives them the knowledge of the right tone."

March 30, 2012.",,"Karawari (called anduk apianak ‘our mouth’ by its over three thousand speakers) is spoken in eight main villages and countless bush camps in the area of the lower Karawari river (Yimaria), lower Konmei creek (Kwanmar), and upper Kangramai creek (Yiŋun) in the Sepik River (Ambiamai) basin of Papua New Guinea. There are four dialectal groups (the local names are in brackets): a) Konmei (Kwanmar,Siŋgara), Manjamai (Karɨŋgupa, Masamai), Kundiman (Kundiman); b) Meikerobi (Maiprokin), Kaiwaria (Kaiwarian), Kungriambun (Kuŋgriambun, Warɨpanai); c) Masandenai (Masɨndaŋgwan), and d) Ambonwari (Ambanwurin, Manjimakan). Being one of the languages of the Lower Sepik Family Karawari shows immense similarities with closely related Yimas language (well documented by William A. Foley) although the two languages are not mutually intelligible. The distinguishing characteristic of the Lower Sepik Family (belonging to a large group of New Guinean languages known as Papuan or non-Austronesian) is that all six languages of this family (Murik, Kopar, Angoram, Chambri, Yimas, and Karawari) are morphologically agglutinative, employing a large number of both prefixes and suffixes. The numeral system of Karawari is based on fingers and toes. There are two bases: five and ten (instead of additional twenty as it is the case in related Yimas language). Other higher numbers after 20 to 100 are as followingː 21. sumburiŋɡar simipaynyamban; 22. sumburiŋɡar simipaynyasimipay…; 29. sumburiŋɡar simipaynyasambawsanɨm; 30. sumburiŋɡar simianmaw; 40 sumburiŋɡar samunum; 50. sumburiŋɡar suam; 60. sumburiŋɡar sambaymbia; 70. sumburiŋɡar sambasimipay; 80. sumburiŋɡar sambasimianmaw, 90. sumburiŋɡar sambawsanɨm; 100. sumburiŋɡar sumburi. Bodily counting goes as follows: one (only the thumb on the left hand is compressed), two (the forefinger covers the compressed thumb on the left hand), three (the middle finger and the forefinger cover the compressed thumb on the left hand), four (the middle finger, the forefinger and the third finger cover the compressed thumb on left hand), five (all the fingers cover the compressed thumb on the left hand), six (thumbs of both hands are put together, the fingers on the left hand are stretched, the fingers on the right hand are compressed), seven (hands as in number six and the forefinger on the right hand gets stretched), eight (hands as in number seven and the middle finger on the right hand gets stretched), nine (hands as in number eight and the fourth finger on the right hand gets stretched), ten (all the fingers are stretched while the thumbs and hands are pressed together as in prayer). Numbers from ten to nineteen are made of sumburi ‘ten’, conjunction -a- ‘and’, and a number from one to nine. For number twenty sumburi ‘ten’ gets marked for plural sumburiŋgar ‘tens’ while the number simipay ‘two’ follows. In short, twenty can be translated as ‘two tens’. The counting of the numbers from eleven to twenty begins at the small toe on the left foot. People rarely count over twenty in Karawari language but use Tok Pisin instead: e.g. 200 (tu handet), 1000 (tausen), 2000 (tu tausen). The numerals vary depending on what (noun) is counted. In the above example the suffix in mban ‘one’ and prefixes in simipay ‘two’ and simianmaw ‘three’ (and in higher numbers which include these three numbers) are those used in the nominal class to which yamɨndaŋ ‘finger’, as a part of the body, belongs. Another popular way of counting, and nowadays used in the Elementary School, is by referring to kɨnɨŋ ‘node’. In the past nodes that were tied on leaves marked the number of days, which had to pass before an event or meeting would take place. Whenever using ‘nodes’ the counting goes as follows: mbaŋ ‘one’, kripay ‘two’, krianmaw ‘three’. Again, all the higher numbers which include these three numbers also follow the nominal class to which kɨnɨŋ ‘node’ belongs. Adverbial numbers follow this pattern:kɨnɨŋ mbaŋgɨna ‘once’ (Lit. 'on one node'), kɨnɨŋgri kripanya ‘twice’ (Lit. 'on two nodes'). Let us also note that for counting humans number one is mban if male and mbanma if female, while numbers for two, iŋgɨnbay, and three, iŋgianmaw, are the same for men and women. Karawari phonemic system Karawari, a Papuan language spoken in Ambonwari village, is a four-vowel language: /a/, /ɨ/, /i/, /u/. Mid-vowels /e/ and /o/ are merged to /a/. There are two semivowels: /w/ and /y/. Bilabial voiced stop /b/ is usually preceded by bilabial nasal /m/ and in few cases by dental-apical /n/. The latter precedes dental voiced stop /d/. In short, /d/ and /b/ mainly appear in clusters and rarely as independent consonants. When they are not found in clusters then bilabial voiced stop /b/ is moved towards bilabial voiceless stop /p/, while dental voiced stop /d/ is moved towards dental voiceless stop /t/. While /p/ is often heard /t/ is heard only rarely. The reason for the lack of independent dental voiced stop /d/ as well as of dental voiceless stop /t/ seems to be due to the preference of majority of Ambonwari speakers who use dental fricative /s/ instead (it can be seen that all the numbers except mban ‘one’ begin with /s/ which is occasionally and only by some speakers replaced by /t/). Velar /ŋ/ indicates an 'eng' with /g/inaudible. When /g/ is heard after such a nasal, it is written as /ŋg/."

The people I work with do speak an Angkuic language, and the old name for them is Muak Sa-aak. They have essentially adopted the Tai numbers, but the speakers I work with (Wan Fai village) have adopted them for all numbers: The number one I do have the word [ʔak²] as well as the Tai number; they will say, for example, [ʔic² ʔak²] for ""one person"" (or other nouns), but if it is more than one, it would be [ʔic² sɔːŋ³ kun³] ""two people. This construction is the only place I see [ʔak²]. Regarding tones, this is phonemicized data; 1=low tone, stiff voice. 2=constricted/glottalized tone.

Numerals in Tariana are: pa:- 'one', ñama- (variant: yama) 'two', madali- 'three'. They require obligatory agreement in numeral classifier. The set of numeral classifiers coincides with the set of noun class markers, except for the animate classifiers. Numerals use -ita 'generic animate' and -hipa 'animate (human)'. Number four in Tariana is a deverbal nominalisation: ka-iphu-nipe → kephunipe (rel-accompany-nom) 'four, lit. the one who has a companion'. Numerals from five onwards are compounds. They are formed slightly differently in Santa Rosa dialect, and in Periquitos dialect. Numerals bigger than five are rarely used, and are often substituted by loan numbers from Portuguese. Numerals from six to nine are formed as follows: one side of a hand (and) one+classifier follows (+classifier), e.g.: peme-kapi pa:-na di-anata-na 'six' one+side+indf-hand one-cl:vert 3sgnf-follow-cl:vert (lit. 'the side of one hand and one vertical one, i.e. finger, which follows') A variant is pemekapi pa:-na dyanata (without the 'vertical' classifier -na at the end). Number ten is literally '(all) two hands', e.g. ñama-kapi thuya-na-pe pu:we (two- hand all-cl:vert-pl monkey) 'ten monkeys' (lit. 'all two hands monkey'), or n) ama-kapi-da-pe pu:we (two-hand-cl:round-pl monkey) 'ten monkeys'. Numbers from eleven to fourteen are either 'two hands add one (two, three) +classifier', e.g. ñama-kapi di-yena pa:-na (two-hand 3sgnf-become one-cl:vert) 'eleven' (lit. 'two hands plus one'); or 'two hands and one+classifier on one foot follows', e.g. ñama-kapi-da-pe pa:-da pa:-hipama di-anata (two-hand-cl:round-pl one-cl:round one-foot 3sgnf-follow) 'eleven'. The numeral 'fifteen' consists of 'two hands add a foot', as in ñama-kapi di-yena hipama (two-hand 3sgnf-become foot) 'fifteen' (lit. 'two hands plus a foot'), or of '(all) two hands one foot are over', as in (thuya) ñama-kapi pa:-hipama di-sisa ((all) two- hand one-foot 3sgnf-end) 'fifteen'. Numbers from sixteen to nineteen have the following structure: '(all) two hands add one/two/three+classifier on one foot', e.g. ñama-kapi di-yena pa:-da pa:-hipama (two-hand 3sgnf+follow one-cl:round one-foot) 'sixteen'. Number twenty has the structure of '(all) two hands two all feet': ñama-kapi thuya ñama-hipama thuya (two -hand all two-foot all) 'two hands and two feet', or: 'all two hands (all) two feet are over': ñama-kapi thuya ñama-hipama di-sisa (two-hand all two-foot 3sgnf-end). The number twenty resembles a Tucano type, and not a Baniwa type: twenty in Baniwa is nawiki 'one person: twenty (presumably, fingers and toes)'. The variability in the structure of compound numerals is probably due to their obsolescence (see Aikhenvald forthcoming-a on Portuguese numerals used in Tariana). Numbers from five to fifteen in the Periquitos dialect are as follows: pa-kapi i-sisa (imp-hand indf-end) 'five' pa-kapi pa-da hi:pa (imp-hand one-cl:round ?) 'six' pa-kapi ñama-da hi:pa (imp-hand two-cl:round ?) 'seven' pa-kapi madali-da hi:pa (imp-hand three-cl:round ?) 'eight' pa-kapi kehpunipe-da-pe hi:pa (imp-hand four-cl:round-pl ?) 'nine' ñamema pa-kapi (two+cl:side imp-hand) or ñama-kapi i-sisa (two-cl:hand indf-end) 'ten' ñama-kapi i-sisa pa-hyupama pa-da (two-cl:hand indf-end one-cl:foot one-cl:round) 'eleven' ñama-kapi i-sisa pa-hyupama ñama-da (two-cl:hand indf-end two-cl:foot one-cl:round) 'twelve' ñama-kapi i-sisa pa-hyupama madali-da (two-cl:hand indf-end one-cl:foot three-cl:round) 'thirteen' ñama-kapi i-sisa pa-hyupama kehpunipe-da-pe (two-cl:hand indf-end one-cl: foot four-cl:round-pl) 'fourteen' ñama-kapi i-sisa pa-hyupama i-sisa (two-cl:hand indf-end one-cl:foot indf-end) 'fifteen' The term for twenty is ñama-kapi i-sisa ñama-hyupama i-sisa (two-cl:hand indf- end two-cl:foot indf-end)."

The three forms above are the only ones I found, and they only ever occurred with classifiers: -le, for the general classifier, and a few other marginal classifiers (-phe for round-ish objects, -lem for days.) All other numerals that I encountered were taken directly from Nepali (and used without classifiers). Thulung is in serious contact with Nepali, and very endangered as a result. When I was there, the youngest semi-speakers were in their twenties, and even these were exceptional. One other thing to bear in mind is that this is a small community, and the nearest market is in a zone where a number of minorities come together, so Nepali is used for any real numerical/monetary transaction. An anthropologist called Nicholas Allen did work on Thulung in the early 70's, and he too recorded an almost complete loss of the numeral system. Allen (p.102) says that ""No Thulung that I met knew how to count in Thulung beyond four (many could only reach three), with the exception of one or two individuals who had learnt AS' system from his book. It is in fact most unlikely that the higher numbers were ever in current use."" The AS system he is referring to is a system for counting up to 100, which Agam Sing Dewsa RAI put in a 1944 book about the Thulung language (written in Nepali). I wonder if Toba just cited that system? As for tones, Allen had found traces of tone in Thulung (it took him years to notice it, and it wasn't consistently applied by all speakers--also, he found that the great majority of the words in the language did not have tone), but I found that any tones there may have been were lost by the time I got there. Tone loss through contact is a documented pattern, and as Nepali has no tone, I think that younger speakers must have decided over time that any differences they heard in the few words older speakers made tone distinctions for were irrelevant... Anyway, I feel confident in saying no tone in current-day Thulung. As for Koyi, there are no earlier records, so who knows, but I didn't see evidence of tone when I was there. Interesting if you consider the difference between Thulung and Koyi—both communities of about the same sizes, yet Koyi has a productive (and used) numeral system, whereas Thulung has borrowed almost the entire system from Nepali.

November 11, 2009. February 5, 2014.",decimal,"Tina Sambal has a decimal system similar to that of Abenlen Ayta. Tina Sambal actually does not have stress but short and long pre-final syllables. But when Western linguists analyze it, they hear it as “stress”. That is, words which have a short vowel in the pre-final syllable are analyzed as having stress in the final syllable because that’s what it sounds like to Western ears, e.g. lo’wa is actually [lowa:] (the colon stands for length). And the words with long vowels in the pre-final syllable are said to have stress in the pre-final syllable, ex. ma’polo ‘ten’ which is actually [mapo:lo:]. The mark for stress which is used in the list above is the apostrophe { ‘ } and is written before the so–called stressed syllable. Probably this request came because some of the Tina Sambal numbers do not have a stress mark in the list below. The two-syllable words which do not have a stress mark are words which have two consonants next to each other in the middle of the word and therefore are neutral for stress in Tina Sambal. The word can be said either way, stressing the first or the second syllable because the first syllable is closed and so both syllables are short. So there is no fixed “stress” on either syllable. Examples are aʔsa {a-sa} ‘one’ (note: the question mark is used by the writer for the glottal stop which is also a consonant and in Tina Sambal written as a hyphen { - }). This could be pronounced as ‘aʔ-sa or as aʔ’sa. The same is true for the following words: aʔpat {a-pat} ‘four’ could be pronounced as ‘aʔpat or aʔ’pat aʔnom {a-nom} ‘six’ could be pronounced as ‘aʔnom or aʔ’nom and all the words which contain these numbers."

The final /-me/ in these words is an adverbializer; i.e., Dutch/Portuguese numerals are borrowed as if they were nouns, and must be adverbialized by /me/ before they can be used as quantifiers. Only /tëinken/ 'one; alone; only' is really very frequent; /ëëkënë/ is still fairly frequent (at least everybody knows it); /ëerao/ is less known as 'three', and /ëepema/ much less known as 'four'.

trum1247-1,"Trumai, Xingú Park, Brazil",trum1247,Trumai,tpy,South America,-11.8119,-53.5717,Trumai,Trumai.htm,"Dr. Raquel Guirardello-Damian, University of the West of England, UK. / State University of Campinas-Unicamp Brazil, February 4, 2009.",,"1) In Trumai, higher numerals are built on the basis of the lower ones, and they involve the words for 'hand' (kʼad), 'foot' (pitsʼ) and 'finger' (kɛl ; apa). 2) The numerals 1-10 were obtained with several native speakers of Trumai. The consultants offer the same data for the numerals 1-5. They diverge with regard to the higher numerals: some consultants use the word apa, others use kɛl. There is a semantic difference between these two words: kɛl is 'finger' related to the rest of the hand (kʼad) - i.e., we talk about the finger, but the rest of the hand is also evoked. Apa is just 'finger' - i.e. the focus is only the part of the hand that corresponds to what we call 'finger' in English. Although speakers offer numerals from 1 to 10 during elicitation, in daily life they usually use only the numerals from 1 to 5 (these numerals can be found in conversations and in texts). For higher amounts, speakers show the fingers (for example, a woman says ""Buy knives for me, like this"" and shows 7 fingers. This means that she wants 7 knives). 3) The numerals 11-20 were obtained with one speaker only. They are never used in daily life. Some speakers not even know them. Maybe this is why we find variation in their forms (note that the consultant sometimes use the word apa, sometimes kɛl). 4) The overall analysis for Trumai numerals is this: For the forms 6-9, we can say that the idea of 5 is implicit. The logic is this: you counted all the fingers of one hand = 5; now you cross and go to the other hand, adding its fingers. For the forms 11-15, the idea of 10 is implicit. The logic is this: you finished counting the fingers of the hands = 10; now you start counting the fingers of one foot. For the forms 16-19, the idea of 15 is implicit. The logic is this: you counted all the fingers of the hands (10) and all the fingers of one foot (5) = 15; now you cross and go to the other foot, adding its fingers. 5) With regard to the numeral 3: Although we can analyze the term into two parts (huʃ + t ̪ahmɛ), it is not possible to determine the meaning of the second part (t ̪ahmɛ). I have asked my consultants, but they do not know it; they just know the meaning of the whole combination. t̪ahmɛ does not occur elsewhere in the language, and any speculations about its original meaning are just speculations. It does not mean 'other' (the word for 'other' is amonkɛ). It does not mean 'second' either (there are no ordinal numerals in Trumai. In order to indicate the position of an entity in a sequence, the speakers use descriptive terms such as 'the one in the front', 'the one near it', 'the one in the middle', 'the one in the back'). Maybe t̪ahmɛ was originally a modifier meaning something like 'a bigger X'. I speculate this because the language has a special modifier for indicating that a particular entity is a big version of another entity. It could be that t̪ahmɛ was a modifier of the same type - but this is just my speculation."

In the following list of numbers, I have used the classifier “-ga”, which is used when counting fingers. The plural of “-ga” is “-pa”, and is it used for the numbers four (4) and beyond. In common usage, the only numbers that are used are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. Numbers beyond 10 were all included using the expression “many”. The numbers, other than 1,2,3,4,5,10, were elicited, and exist, although there is controversy as to how to express them. For example, I have been told that the number six (6) is: sihkawãbòpehti ahpebò sihkagápêdîpearepa. I have observed that when a Tuyuca wants to express a number larger than 5, he indicates each item on his fingers (naming each of his children, for example), starting with the little finger on the left hand, and when he arrives at the total, he shows the total number of fingers, and says: hã. I also observed a Tuyuca indicate the number 15 in this manner: He crossed his left leg over the right leg, indicated 10 with his fingers, and put the little finger of the left hand next to the big toe of the left foot, to indicate 15. I also observed a Tuyuca indicate the number 20 by showing both hands, and looking down at his feet, while lowering his hands a bit to indicate that he was including all ten toes. In other words, the numbers that I elicited above are not used in everyday speech. Presently the Tuyucas continue to use the Tuyuca numbers for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10. If they want to indicate other numbers, they use the Spanish number system. The following are the morphemes used above, and their meanings: -ga form with three dimensions -pa plural of “-ga” -bõ hand dùhpó foot -pehtí complete ahpé other -pêdîpéa to pass from one object to another nearby -hêyê (only used in these numbers) -re nominalizer"

Like other Aru languages, the Ujir numerals for ‘seven’ and ‘eight’ are complex numerals. Dubusam is an additive numeral (6+1) composed of dubu ‘six’ and -sam, apparently historically derived from, ‘one’. Karua is an multiplicative numeral (4x2) composed of ka ‘four’ and rua ‘two’. The numeral ‘ten’ is also complex, being composed of ui ‘tens’ and sia ‘one’. Higher decades are formed by replacing sia with another numeral, thus: ui rua ‘twenty’, ui lati ‘thirty’, ui ka ‘forty’ etc. The numerals ‘one’. This means there are apparently two forms of the numeral ‘one’ (set or sia) in Ujir. The choice between these forms is dependent on the arithmetical context. Set is used in additive contexts, that is, where one referent (1) or an additional one referent is added to a higher numeral (2). (1) letay set canoe one ‘one canoe’ (2) letay ui rua ma set canoe tens two plus one ‘twenty-one canoes’ Sia is used in multiplicative contexts to create higher numerals that multiplicands of ‘one’, such as (3), (4) and (5). (3) letay ui sia canoe ten one ‘ten canoes’ (4) letay rat sia canoe hundred one ‘one hundred canoes’ (5) letay ribu sia canoe thousand one ‘one thousand canoes’ 2 Sia has a further use outside of numeral contexts. In (6) and (7), sia is not combined with another numeral, but is used by itself with a noun to denote specific indefinite reference (‘a certain’, ‘a particular’ etc.). (6) Fit sia, anin dibil,… night one wind stiff ‘On a certain night, there was a stiff breeze, … (7) Waktu sia, a-ratan fana sia,… time one 3.ACT-reach village one ‘One time, (the boat) reached a certain village,… Formation of higher numerals.

When they give away piles of yams at feasts they keep track of how many they give by keeping a small piece of wood (I seem to recall that they call it ''ruba'') for every 20 yams. In other words, if they have kept 5 ''ruba'', they know that they gave away 100 yams and would expect to get a similar amount (or more) back at some later time. Other higher numbers can be formed as followsː 21. iyapana eyaka mena kewowena ida eyaka mena (person one only finished hand one only) 22. iyapana eyaka mena kewowena ida apeya (person one only finished hand two) 29. iyapana eyaka mena kewowena ida daikere kewowena daikere apeya apeya (person one only finished hand one-side finished one-side two two. 30. iyapana eyaka mena kewowena ida esida mena (person one only finished hand above only) 40. iyapana apeya (person two) 41. iyapana apeya kewowena ida eyaka mena (person one only finished hand one only) The system goes on and on, but as I said, this is purely academic.

The phonetic actualization of the phoneme we symbolize as l in Kaugel is a lateral affricate (stop plus lateral fricative). Before the back vowels a, o, and u, it is a velar lateral affricate, and pronounced in the alveolar position before the front vowels i and e. The 'r' is flapped, and occurs almost exclusively word initially The simple stops 'p' 't' and 'k' tend to be aspirated word-initially and, word medially the k is voiced, the p becomes a voiced bilabial fricative, and the t simply loses its aspiration but is not voiced. There are only five vowels - 'a' as in 'father'; 'e' as in 'egg"", 'i' as in 'pin', 'o' as in 'not' and 'u' as in 'put'. There is also a set of pre-nasalized stops, which are now written with the pre-nasalization because of pressure from literate native speakers. These are 'mb', 'nd', 'ng', and 'nj'. Two nasal sounds 'm' and 'n' are as in English. The phones 's' and 't' are actually mutually exclusive in their distribution, so we originally wrote both as 't', but once again, pressure from native speakers has caused us to now write 's' and 't' separately orthographically. 2) There are actually several Kaugel counting systems. Sadly, most have now fallen into disuse in favour of the Tok Pisin or English words, though there has been some revival of lower numbers in the vernacular elementary schools in recent years. I have presented as much as I know of the most common system, which you will quickly see is four-based, with something going on as multiples of 12 also. Neither of us knows the word for 36 but we feel it has to exist. Number above that tend to be based on the numeral for 24. A paper was written by a Nancy Bowers of New Zealand many years ago covering all the counting systems, the one I have provided for you, another one which is used only for counting game and does not go into high numbers, and a third which is based on body parts and goes up to 100. We elicited this one from an old chief in our original village, but it went up in smoke when our house was burnt down by a mentally disturbed man. This was in the days before computers. If you could get hold of Nancy's paper it would be helpful to you I am sure. 3) For larger numbers these days the people use foreign words such as anderete or tausen or even paono which means 20 (the former Australian currency was the pound which was made up of 20 shillings). 4) Finally, let me comment on the shape of the numerals themselves. All I need to add really, for a fellow linguist, is that the nga~nge morpheme is the genetive suffix. We translate it in this context something like ""in the system of"", so eg rureponga talo would be ""two in the system of 12"" which, in this case equals 10. Ordinal numbers are made by adding the 3S dependent verb suffix to the stem of the give verb, si- though this in no way retains its original meaning when used in this context, thus eg. yepoko sipe means 'third'."

vedd1240-1,"Vedda (Veddah), Sri Lanka",vedd1240,Veddah,ved,Eurasia,6.97396,81.2618,Indo-European,Vedda.htm,"Dr. Philip Baker, University of Westminster, London, UK., July 31, 2009.",,"Vedda does have three counting systems. One consists of Sinhala numerals to which -may [maj] is added (this is the fusion of two Sinhala emphatic suffixes). the second has a base of 5 so that six is ""five more 1"", seven is ""five more 2"" (using Sinhala elements but no such system exists in Sinhala). The third includes no spoken numbers. Instead fingers are displayed, as follows. The number 12 consists of a display of ten fingers followed by a word which can be glossed as 'so much', followed by a display of two fingers. Similarly 26 would be ten fingers + ten fingers + six fingers. But no spoken words to fill in on your form. I have not done any work on 'Modern"" Vedda for more than two years and do not expect to have any time to get back to that for at least two months. My data are partly from recordings I made and partly from published sources. The latter do not mark stress or distinguish between [a] and [ə] This is because there is variation between these two vowels which is almost always predictable from stress placement, and since the authors of these publications are Sinhalese and therefore know where the stress falls it does not occur to them to mark this. In the usual system, Veddas almost always add -ma to the normal Sinhala form. This is the emphatic suffix in Sinhala (but is rarely used with numbers in that language). these are the forms of numbers where there is an immediately following noun. In Sinhala, numbers can also follow the nouns they qualify but then they require a final - y [j] which historically meant 'exactly' or 'precisely'. In such cases the stress shifts from the first syllable to the final syllable, and what had been final, unstressed ə changes to stressed [aj]. In Sinhala, the base forms of the numerals are used both in counting 1, 2, 3, etc. - éka, déka, túna, etc. and when followed by the noun they qualify. (Acute accent for stress.) When following the noun, the corresponding forms are ekáy, dekáy, tunáy, etc. In ""modern"" vedda, preceding the noun the forms are ékəma, dékəma, túnəma, etc. The forms used in counting are: ékəmáy, dékəmáy, túnəmáy, etc. My research has been concerned almost exclusively with identifying features of ""modern"" Vedda which are not of Sinhala origin. Thus the numbers are of limited interest to me and i have never tried to elicit all the numbers from, say, 1 to 100. The ones given below are simply those which occur in my data. As indicated in an earlier message, copied below, to me the only interesting thing in this area is knowledge of two other systems which were formerly used, what might be called the tava and mettay systems described here."

Thus, traditionally the kinja (they call themselves 'kinja') counted only up to three; amounts higher than three were referred to simply as ‘several, many’. Today, with the modern necessity for handling money and the introduction of western mathematical concepts through the village schools, the kinja started using Portuguese loanwords to refer to numbers higher than three. These borrowed numerals occur in the same position as the native words meaning ‘one,’ ‘two,’ or ‘three.’ Less commonly, Portuguese numerals for ‘one,’ ‘two,’ or ‘three’ may also be used instead of the native words, especially by the younger speakers.

Counting was not considered a main part of daily living in the earlier days after entered the indigenous area (February, 1966). Some concepts which were important wereː few, many, a pair, but not necessarily the individual numbers. In fact, you could ask a person how many children he/she had, and they would have to figure it out on their hands and toes. When counting they would often count in twos, or pairs, so that counting on their appendages, for arriving at seven they would count on their fingersː ''two, two, two, one'' which would equal seven. Also, in counting the would start with their left hand, move to the right, then lift the left foot from eleven to fifteen, but then the problem came since you could not lift both feet off the ground! As more and more have received Spanish education, and the necessity for handing money has entered the culture, there has been more and more use of numbers. The use of numbers is switching more to Spanish, though they may still related to those not speaking Spanish in the numbering system of twenty and below. In giving the numbers, one must also recognize that there are short cuts to expressing them. Examples will be supplied for the first number in the series below, but may be applied to following numbers. In the numbering system it is important to distinguish between animate and inanimate. Then with the descriptive or bound noun forms you have the main counting method. The following have been written without the stresses and pitches, except for the first few numbers. Also being written phonemically, one should refer to the phonemic statement for such areas as nasal penetration, etc. The following is the adjectival form which may be usedː e.g., hikʉ̃ - ''one masculine'', hikʉ̃ ʉ̃bʉ̃ - one man hikõ - ''one feminine'', hikaro - ''one indefinite'' pʉarã - ''two (people)'', pʉarã ʉ̃bʉ̃ - two men, pʉaro - ''two things''. Other higher numbers areː 21. hika bohocʉ yee kõro, apĩ hikaɡa pedĩtuaro (litː ''one person poss. as many as, other one (masc.) one or appendage'') 40. pʉarã bohoca yee kõro (litː ''two people POSS as many as '') 50. pʉarã bohoca yee kõro, apĩ bohocʉ pʉabõkõro peti 100. hikabõkõro bohoca yee kõro 200. pʉabõkõro bohoca yee kõro (litː ''as many appendages as you would have on ten people!'') Above this number you still could make up the number and they would understand what is being said, but usually you would come up with a phrase something like ''bʉaro paʉ'' using intonation for emphasis which would translateː ''really as lot (of people/thing - putting in the noun for description of what you are talking about)''."

waiw1244-2,"Waiwai, Brazil, Guyana",waiw1244,Waiwai,waw,South America,1.50881,-59.1417,Cariban,Waiwai.htm,"Mr. Roland Hemmauer, PhD Student, Leiden University, Netherlands, October 22, 2007.",,"Tunayana has a simple numeral system. The numbers ‘5’ and ‘10’ are morphologically and semantically transparent: The number 'five can be expressed by ' jɨm 'hɨthɔ' ( litː 'its father's head) or ' ɛːtʃɔmɛ ka'mɔːɾɨ' ( litː 'our hands half-way'). Number 'ten' can be expressed ' ahnɔɾɔ ka'mɔːɾɨ' (litː ' all of our hands') or 'taˈɾaːwaɾa ka'mɔːɾɨ' (litː ' our hands in a finished manner' The word ka'mɔːɾɨ ‘our hands’ can shift to first position in all numerals in which it occurs, e.g. ahnɔɾɔ ka'mɔːɾɨ ‘all of our hands’. This might have to do with con­trastive focus that is still possible because the construction is transparent (i.e. ‘all of our hands, not just half of it’). Occasionally, I’ve recorded ahnɔɾɔ ka'mɔːɾɨ accompanying other numerals as well, without any change in meaning, e.g. taˀɗɔ'jɛːrɛ ka'mɔːɾɨ ‘4’. For numbers 6 to 9 and from 11 onwards, Dutch numerals are used. The smaller Dutch numerals are also used, especially when counting time units (e.g. “on the third day”, “at 4 o’clock”). Dutch numerals are either learnt directly at school or taken over via Trio/Tiriyó, often together with the Trio/Tiriyó adverbial suffix -me.[1] None of these numerals seems to be integrated into the Tunayana/Katwena lexicon. Firstly, some of these numerals violate native rules of vowel length, syl­lable structure, and consonant clustering (see phonological features in separate file). Secondly, my observation is that speakers try to do their best to imitate the foreign-language standard, and that their pronunciation of numerals depends strongly on their proficiency in Dutch and Trio/Tiriyó. Therefore, there is no can­onical form of foreign-language numerals, but phonetic variation (The numerals 3-12 given in the table above give an approximation of the pronunciation of one of my informants). I have never noticed any older speaker using numbers beyond 12. Speakers who have been living in Guyana for a longer time use English terms (only attested for ‘1’ and ‘2’). In native counting, when counting beyond 5, older speakers use relative coun­ting terms instead, like ‘the next one’, ‘another one’, ‘once again’ etc. These are in free variation with each other, which suggests that they do not form a lexical­ized system either. Furthermore, the word taˀɗɔ'jɛːrɛ‘4’ can also refer to any even number higher than 4. Uneven numbers, on the other hand, are referred to by the term aˀɗɔmɾa. The literal meanings of these words are ‘having a peer’ and ‘not having a peer’, respectively. (One speaker also used aˀɗɔmɾa as a numeral with a defined value, but I have not been able to figure out whether it referred to ‘3’ or to ‘5’). Tunayana/Katwena is also strongly influenced by the related Waiwai dialect, in which a prestigious Bible translation has been written. As a consequence, some speakers use Waiwai forms instead: tSewøe ‘1’, asaùkö ‘2’, srwaw ‘3’. Some former subdialects of Tunayana/Katwena might also have had asaùkö ‘2’ and srwaw ‘3’ originally, but this cannot be proven. PS: I use to omit predictable vowel length and stress and to write only phonemic vowel length in my own transcription, which reads as follows: tewñi ‘1’, sa:ki / sakfaki ‘2’, sorwawu ‘3’, ta’ëoyere ‘4’, yim hitho / e:čo=me kamori ‘5’, ahnoro kamori / tara=wara kamori ‘10’."

Hawkins, Summer Institute of Linguistics, Brazil, December 10, 1993.",,"Actually in numbers was not a part of the Wai Wai culture, the numerals they used were 1 to 3, several, a good many. The only time the Wai Wais used numbers accurately was then weaving designed basketry, but even then they did not have names for the numerals. They apparently just noticed that a certain pattern needed one or two more strands of material. They sometimes uses the word taknoyere meaning 'paired' to mean 'four'. But its use was rare. They has apparently learned to use fingers and toes on which to count, but only a few had learned this apparently from Wapishana tribe. Now those in Guyana use the numbers in English and those in Brazil use the numbers in Portuguese and those in Surinam use the Dutch numerals. Some are becoming fairly fluent in using the numerals. But in general the Wai Wais are very slow in learning arithmetic."

In their trade negotiations with other clans, however, the Wambule tribesmen sometimes use so called ‘secretive’ forms, of which I have been able to record nisi ‘two’, tin bryamci ‘three fingers’ for the numeral ‘three’, cyaŋbwaŋti ‘four’, kwal la-bryam ‘five’ and dui labryam ‘ten’. The latter two literally translate as ‘one hand finger’ and ‘two hand finger’, although bryamci is the word general used for ‘finger’. Hodgson (1857: 341) lists the ‘Chouras’ya’ forms kolo ‘one’, nik’si ‘two’, súm’makha ‘three’ and phíbakha ‘four’. The ordinary numerals one to twelve are listed above. The native numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ is considered a nominal on morphosyntactic grounds. Numerals which are used as an argument take the markers required by Wambule grammar. Numerals usually precede other adnominal modifiers. The numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ is a very interesting form, since its ongoing use seems to be connected to the fact that this word does not only serve to indicate exactly one entity of a certain species, but is also be used as the equivalent of the English indefinite article a. The numeral kwalo ~ kwal ‘one’ can be analysed as a lexicalised combination of the bound morpheme <kwa·> ‘one’ plus the locative marker <·lo>. The bound morpheme <kwa·> ‘one’ is also found in the reduplicative compound adjective kwa?-kwa? ‘each, either, separately’ and the partly reduplicated quantifier kwakwalo ~ kwakwal ‘some, any’. The partly reduplicated form kwalo-kwal expresses the sense of ‘one by one, one at a time, by turns’."

The senary counting system is almost exclusively used for counting yam tubers, which are the staple diet of the people. exchange of yams is of great importance for feasts and exchange marriages. Other side of this special domain, people almost never count in Kómnzo. Nowadays, they used English terms. In the past, at least that is my hypothesis, people did not count higher than 3 or 4. In fact, the term for three (etha) is frequently used to mean 'few' without a special number values assigned. When the yam counting takes place, two men pick up three tubers each and move them from one pile to the newly started pile. With each time the move 6 yams and each time, they call out the number terms from 1 to 6. Oddly enough, they employ terms which are slightly different. At least for 2 [ɛnda̯] and 3 [eða̯], people use [jə̯nda̯] and [jə̯ðɔ] respectively. These are the terms from the neighboring variety Wára (also found in Anta). There is no explanation for this, when counting things other than yams or even when counting yams without this public ritualistic counting, they would use the above mentioned Kómnzo terms. When the two counters have finished one cycle of 1 to 6, a single yam is put aside and they start over again. The single yams which have been put to the side represent a unit of 36 each now. This unit is called [fə̯ta̯]. This procedure of counting can be repeated with the [fə̯ta̯] yams. In this way, one ends up with terms for the power of 6. 6x6 = [fə̯ta̯] 6x6x6 = [tarumba] 6x6x6x6 = [ndamnɔ] 6x6x6x6x6 = [wærəmɛkə] There is no term for 6 to the power of 6.

And my older brother and I remember a slightly different pronunciation of the number 5, which may just be our mistake, but I left it in. One other thing: of course the full form of each number was used for stating the number of objects or people. But when just counting along, after the number 5, one usually just said, .. aria hisaka, arai manamo... (and one, and two..), taking the last five as already read, until the next multiple of five. So counting usually sounded like: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, plus 1, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4, 10, plus 1, plus 2, plus 3, plus 4, 15,... That is what I have to add.

wawa1246-1,"Wawa, Cameroun",wawa1246,Wawa,www,Africa,6.68974,11.7802,Atlantic-Congo,Wawa.htm,"Dr. Marieke Martin, Department of Linguistics, University of Kent, Canterbury, Kent, U.K., October 10, 2012, July 26, 2013.",,"The numeral systems of Wawa is complex through heavy borrowings from Vute and Fulfulde. The traditional system is based on 5 and 20, while the modern system is based on 5 and 10 and mostly borrowed from Fulfulde. There are two words for ‘one’, mŏsī and mŏī. Both words are used and the preferred one varies between different Wawa dialects. The stem mŏ- is derived for diminutive -(s)í. ‘One’ is the only number derived for diminutive, while all others are derived for plural. The numerals from ‘2’ to ‘21’ are shown in table. In this table only the Wawa numbers are presented, most of which are not used anymore. Anecdotally, I refused to speak Fulfulde in the village and only used Wawa numbers when speaking to people, which often led to hesitations by my opponents, who had to calculate with their fingers to understand the number I used. The numbers in Wawa are subject to heavy borrowing. The average person would only use the numbers 1-5 in Wawa; ‘10’ is probably borrowed from Vute and the rest from Fulfulde. Whether the number ‘ten’ is a loan or not could not be established certainly. The Vute (Banyo) numeral ‘10’ certainly is homophone (own research) and it was proposed by different Wawa speakers that tʃɔ́ŋ was a borrowing from Vute. However, one old lady (said to be over 100 years old) in Oumyari claimed that bə̆ntə̄ was the ‘real’ and original Wawa word for ‘10’. This could not be confirmed through neither the dialect survey (which was only done by having two informants for each dialect), nor other Mambiloid languages (Connell p.c.). What may have been a formerly used form is tén-téēnbə̄. This could not be confirmed but was come up with at several times by speakers when asked for another word for ‘10’. The Wawa dialect of Mbengedje has a mono-morphemic word for ‘eight’, sát. I have not come across any cognate for the word sát in Oumyari and the other dialects and was very surprised about its existence in Mbengedje Wawa. As the traditional week is 10 days long, it cannot be related to that. The traditional ‘5’ and ‘20’ based system has been replaced by a ‘5’ and ‘10’ based system, as mentioned above. No one, if not forced through elicitation, uses the traditional ‘20’ base ngwɔ́ī ‘head’ in discourse. Younger generations do not even understand the use of ‘head’ in this context. When forced to speak Wawa they would come up with tʃɔ́ŋ tʃɔ́ŋ nărə̄bə̀ (‘ten ten four’) for ‘forty’ instead of ngwɔ́ī bə̀mbə́ (twenty two). Multiples of ’10 and ‘20’ and their combinations The rule is that when two numbers are connected by bá, they are added, while numbers that follow each other without bá are multiplied, except for the lexicalised numbers 6-9. Numbers can be combined without any tone changes. té-bə̀mbə́ ‘seven’ ngwɔ́ī bə̀mbə́ ‘forty’ ngwɔ́ī bá bə̀mbə́ ‘twenty-two’ ngwɔ́ī nărə̄bə̀ bá tʃɔ́ŋ bá té-mŏī ‘ninety-six’ Fulfulde numbers In everyday speech only the numbers ‘1’-‘5’ are Wawa the rest are Fulfulde (and Vute). The numbers in local Fulfulde are given in table. They are spelt according to the official Fulfulde orthography. The local Fulfulde spoken in Oumyari by non-native speakers is different from native Fulfulde speakers, as the Wawa speakers have assimilated the phonology to match Wawa phonology in many aspects, e.g. the replacement of implosive stops by pulmonic egressive geminate stops. Fulfulde has a base 5’ and ‘10’ system. Large numerals The only large numbers found during fieldwork were ‘100’, which is a compound of ‘5’ and ‘20’ and ‘1000’, which literally means ‘until 10’. These numbers are not used anymore, not understood and it often took consultants several days to come up with the number. All big numbers are in general borrowed from Fulfulde. Among composite numbers the original linking particle be (Fulfulde ‘and’) is omitted and replaced by the Wawa equivalent bá. ranscription of tone There are four level tones in Wawa that can also combine to form surface contour tones. The different tones have been numbered 1 (high) to 4 (low). The following diacritics are used to represent tone in the data: Level tones: tone 1: á tone 2: ā tone 3: ă[1] tone 4: à Surface contours: 1-2 a 1-3 á ̆ 1-4 â 2-1 a 2-3 ā ̆ 2-4 a 3-1 ă ́ 3-2 ă ̄ 3-4 ă ̀ 4-1 ǎ 4-2 a 4-3 à ̆ [1] After the discovery of the fourth tone, I made the decision together with my supervisors, to represent the lower-mid tone (3) with the short mark, as I am analysing the tone system in terms of high, higher- and lower-mid and low. Also, the IPA diacritics for extra high/low do not allow any contours. Numerically, there are more contours including tone 1 and 4 than tone 3, and therefore this diacritic is used."

Amam uses traditional numbers for one and two, and sometimes three. For other numbers they usually only use Tok Pisin or English. On the above table, where there are blanks Tok Pisin is used. Other notesː · Numerals in Amam are handled in a unique manner. Numerals are built from a generic numeral marker na. That is, somewhere after a noun in the noun phrase, a word beginning with na will occur. If the noun is singular, then a noun class suffix will follow the numeral marker. If the noun is dual, then the noun class suffix will be followed by the dual suffix -ar. The noun class that is composed of people and animals does not take a class suffix in the dual forms, so after na simply comes -ar. · In summary, Amam has a generic numeral na, and then the suffixes indicate the actual number. No numeral suffix indicates singularity, while the -ar suffix indicates duality. The -roa suffix indicates plurality for animates, while the -t suffix indicates plurality for inanimates. · As an example, the word for 5 is composed of three morphemes: mor ‘fist’ + na ‘numeral’ + tsi ‘noun class’. Therefore, it literally means ‘one fist’. The word for ten is composed of four morphemes: mor ‘fist’ + na ‘numeral’ + ti ‘noun class’ + ar ‘dual’. Therefore, it literally means ‘two fists’. · Amam has 19 letters in its alphabet, including 14 consonants and 5 vowels. These letters, along with the phonemes they represent, are listed below: /d/, /g/, /ʔ/, /k/, /l/, /m/, /n/, /ŋ/, /p/, /ɾ/, /r/, /s/, /t/, /w/, /y; /a/, /ɛ/, /i/, /o/, /u/"

Similarly, continuing from “six” with a clenched fist and open hand, (s)he repeats the process on the second hand reaching two clenched fists, two hands at “ten”. Likewise for numbers “eleven” to “twenty”, first one foot and then the other are consecutively added to the two clenched fists. Technically, counting continues in multiples of “twenty”, one person, two people, etc. However, these become more and more unwieldy. In practice, specific numbers larger than six, apart from possibly round numbers such as “ten” and “twenty” are rarely used in natural language situations; in reality general number forms such as “many” are used.

Today most would just give Indonesian numeralsfor these, in fact, for most numbers above five (see my comments on the use of Indonesian numbers below). Some further comments on the Lanì counting system (1) I mentioned above that many know Indonesian. Most who do, still use Lanì counting terms for 1 through 3, or even 1 through 5. What is interesting, however, is that when they use Indonesian numerals, they always include the Indonesian term also they are quantifying. For example, in saying 'twelve men' they will not say aap duabelas (which is the Lanì word order of aap 'man' or 'person' in Lanì plus duabelas 'twelve' in Indonesian, but borrow the term being quantified also, saying duabelas orang 'twelve persons.' They will not speak the Indonesian numeral with a Lanì term being quantified. They just put both the counting term and the term being quantified in Indonesian and in Indonesian word order. In the translation of both the Old and New Testaments in Lanì (both have been published by the Indonesian Bible Society as I'm sure you know), we chose to use Indonesian numerals above the numeral 3. This decision was made in the 1970's before the first printing of the Lanì (then called Western Dani) New Testament by the Bible Society. (2) I think it will be of interest to you that the Lanì number days by their number of sleeps. In 1956 when my partner, Don Gibbons, and I were making a long trek in opening up the Ilaga Valley for missionary occupation, the party we were with felt at one point on our trek a team of two should go on ahead to see if the trail was safe from ambush by warriors of an enemy group before we proceeded further. As they got ready to leave, one of the men, Yììmbitu by name, handed me a string with 13 knots in it. He told me to untie one knot for each night I slept while he was gone, and when the 13th knot was untied he would be back. Very interesting. Now let me describe briefly the two orthographies we have used for writing Lanì: (1) the one based on a careful phonemic analysis of Lanì phonology and used in the 1950's and 1960's and (2) the revised Indonesianized orthography used since then. The first displays the actual vowel and consonant phones of Lanì, the second, as used now, is an accommodation for those who read both Lanì and Indonesian. If Lanì speakers had remained isolated as they were in that early period, then the first orthography would have been best for them. Readers, however, were able to quickly adapted to the revised orthography and is the one used today. (1) The first Lanì orthography: Vowels: i, ì, e, a, o, ù, u Consonants: Prenasalized stops: b( ᵐb), d (ᶯd), g (ᵑg), gw (ᵑgᵚ) Voiceless stops: p (p-, -b-, -p), t (t-, -r-, -t), k (k-, -g-, -k), kw (kᵚ-, -gᵚ-) Note: the r is a flap r. Nasals, laterals, continuants: m, n, l, w, y Glottal stop: ' Lexical length of vowel: to express this we write a sequence of two vowels, e.g., aa, ii, etc. Note that the voiceless stops p, t, k, and kw occur voiceless word initial and word final, but as voiced b, r, g, and gw word medial. That is, when a Lanì, in the original orthography, sees p in word medial position he automatically pronounces it as b, and similarly with t in word medial position, he pronounces it r (that is flap r), and sees k and kw in this position pronounces it g and gw. The Indonesianized orthography: Unlike several of the Papuan languages of the highlands (e.g., Mee, Moni, and Nduga) which have only five contrastive vowels, Lanì has seven vowels. The two additional vowels are high open front ì and high open back ù. Our intermission linguistic committee concluded we should write these with grave accent. Using the Indonesianized orthography we write the nasalized stops b, d, g and gw as mb, nd, ngg, and nggw. Note: ngg and nggw are with a double gg because that is how ng and ngw are written in Indonesian. The stops p, t, k, and kw are written as follows: p and b, t and r, k and g, and kw and gw where the voiceless stops p, t, and k always occur word initial or word final only (but kw only word initial), and where the voiced consonants b, r, g, and gw occur only word medially. for example, 'wild animal' and 'his wild animal' are written pakì and opakì in the early phonemic orthography, but as pagì and obagì in the Indonesianized orthography. The nasals, one lateral, continuants and glottal stop remain unchanged in the Indonesianized orthography: m, n, l, w, y, and ' Before I write out the complete list of Lanì numerals you have requested, I will list the first three, first in the original orthography and then in the Indonesianized orthography to illustrate the orthographic difference: Number: Original Orthography: Indonesianized orthography: one abìt ambìt two bete mbere three kenakan kenagan I will not write out the numerals you have requested for Lanì on the questionnaire you provided because most of the Lanì counting terms are lengthy expressions, too long to fit into the space provided."

Nowadays, traditional numerals are more frequently used by the Pilcomayo River communities in Bolivia and some communities from Argentina than by the Bermejo River communities (Argentina). In general, the latter use the Spanish loanwords. The Spanish numeral system has been completely incorporated to the language, with some phonological and morphological adaptations (i.e. [unu]<[uno] (Spanish); [unu-fʷaχ], one-DIM, ‘only one’). Numerals beyond 10 are also Spanish loanwords. Comments on language name: The “Wichi/Weenhayek” name comes from the terms “Wichi” and “Weenhayek”, used in Argentina and Bolivia respectively, to refer to the same language. Comments on dialectal varieties: There are two main diatopic (geographical) varieties of Wichi/Weenhayek called pilcomayeño and bermejeño based on whether the speakers live by the Pilcomayo or the Bermejo Rivers, respectively.

Combinations which have been attested in the corpus are as follows (data mostly from Salombe, et al. 1987:52-53). Note the vowel coalescence which occurs when a bound numeral ending in a is followed by atu ‘hundred’. The expression for ‘fifty’ (taken from Sande, et al. 1991:78) is irregular, as the independent rather than the bound form of ‘five’ is used. The expression ‘nine hundred’ is irregular, where sewatu occurs (instead of expected siatu). sapulu ‘10’ satu ‘100’ sansou ‘1000’ dua pulu ‘20’ duatu ‘200’ duansou ‘2000’ talu pulu ‘30’ talu atu ‘300’ talunsou ‘3000’ pata pulu ‘40’ patatu ‘400’ alima pulu ‘50’ limatu ‘500’ anama pulu ‘60’ anamatu ‘600’ pitu pulu ‘70’ pitu atu ‘700’ walu pulu ‘80’ walu atu ‘800’ sia pulu ‘90’ sewatu ‘900’ Compare also for ten thousand and above: sapulusou ‘10,000’ (Salombe et al. 1987:53) alima pulu nsou ‘50,000’ (Sande, et al. 1991:122) satunsou ‘100.000’ (Salombe et al. 1987:53) duatunsou ‘200,000’ (Sande, et al. 1991:122) Complex numeric expressions are formed by variously combining forms such as above in order of decreasing value. The following are exemplary: s-atu sa-pulu duango one-hundred one-ten two ‘one hundred twelve’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) s-atu sa-pulu pitu one-hundred one-ten seven ‘one hundred seventeen’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) lima atu sa-pulu sango five hundred one-ten one ‘five hundred eleven’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) dua-n-sou s-atu sango two-lg-thousand one-hundred one ‘two thousand one hundred one’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) When quantity is indicated without the use of a classifier or measure word, an independent form of the numeral is used. sango burau ‘one egg’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) duango burau ‘two eggs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) taluango lemba ‘three boats’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) patango burau ‘four eggs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:80) lipa ana ‘six sarongs’ (Sande, et al. 1991:101) bete sassio ‘nine fish’ (Sande, et al. 1991:101) When a classifier or measure word is present, the numeral immediately precedes the classifier or measure word. Both independent and bound forms have been attested in this position for the numerals one through five, but only independent forms for six through nine. sango urra potolo one root pencil ‘one pencil’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) sa-m-baa ana manu one-lg-head child chicken ‘one chick’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) duango bobba surra two flat.object letter ‘two letters’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) dua boba dopi two flat.object board ‘two boards’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) banua-na taluango bobba house-3 three flat.object ‘his three houses’ (Sande, et al. 1991:82) talu m-baa manu three lg-head chicken ‘three chickens’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) patango ganto juku four cut meat ‘four chunks of meat’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) pata m-baa bete four lg-head fish ‘four fish’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) alima ito-na bawine five person-3 female ‘five women’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) alima bae punti five fruit banana ‘five bananas’ (Sande, et al. 1991:81) banua-na lima bobba house-3 five flat.object ‘his five houses’ (Sande, et al. 1991:79) [1] ana litere bae six liter pestled.rice ‘six liters of pestled rice’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) pitu bobba lipa seven flat.object sarong ‘seven sarongs’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) walu tingke bunga eight stem flower ‘eight flowers’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63) sassio baa-na manu nine head-3 chicken ‘nine chickens’ (Salombe et al. 1987:63)"

Lakumarau is a newly discovered language, spoken by approximately 800 people in the village Lakurumau, in the New Ireland Province of Papua New Guinea. So far, Lakurumau has only been briefly mentioned in descriptions of the New Ireland languages an defined as a ""transitional dialect"" or a ""transitional language"" between the neighboring Nalik and Kara. Actually, Lakurumau would be better defined as a member of the language chain of Northern New Ireland, comprising of six different languages (Lavongai/Tungak, Tigak, Tiang, Kara, Nalik and Loxodumau). Due to the pressure of Tok Pisin, the vernacular language in Papua New Guinea, the number of fluent speakers is rapidly sinking and the language is at risk of dying out in the next few decades. Traditionally, Lakurumau speakers were also fluent in the neighboring languages Nalik and Kara, which they used in the relationship with their neighbours. The latter would usually not learn Lakurumau, as they deem it to be a ""very difficult"" and ""unintellegible"" language. Nowadays, even if knowledge of Nalik and Kara is still diffused in Lakurumau, communication with Nalik and Kara speakers takes place more and more often in Tok Pisin. Some Lakurumau speakers are also fluent in Papua New Guinea English. Lakurumau is less and less spoken by younger generations; it is endangered and faces a serious threat of extinction in the next decades.

There is almost no literature on the Sadu ethnic group. The historical background we acquired was mainly from oral narration delivered by the elders in the three hamlets. According to limited local Chinese records and some olders’ oral narrations, it was said that Li clan in Jiaoyuan and Bi clan in Dashuitang hamlet moved from Hetaoyuan Township in Kunyan County and Baofeng Township of Jinning County in the Qing Dynasty. Originally they belonged to a sub-branch of Yi who claimed to be “Samodu”, whose ancestors were referred to “Ximodi” in Tang Dynasty, and as “Ximotu” in Yuan Dynasty. This group of people was named as “Bailuoluo Samodu” after Ming Dynasty. Nowadays, the villagers of the Li clan acknowledge that they are the descendants of Dali Bai nationality, however. They call themselves Sadu. Yet they use different names to distinguish themselves from one hamlet to another. The people from Xincun village call themselves Suonapo. The people from Tashuitang call themselves Tatapo; The people from Jiaoyuan claimed themselves Lilepo. They all were referred as Bai-Yi before 1958. They were designated by the Government as Bai nationality in 1858. Nevertheless, the language is very unique. It is neither intelligible to Yinyuan Bai, nor Dali Bai, nor local Yi. Sadly, we found that the descendants of preceding generations in Hetaoyuan and Baofeng Townships now all have shifted Chinese. Therefore, this group of people was redefined as the Sadu. According the identification, the Sadu language belongs to one of the languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family. However, the Sadu language is a lesser-known language. It is not intelligible to Bai, nor the neighboring Yi. It is necessary to redefine the genetic affiliation explicitly based on core words, phonology, words formation and grammar analysis as well as comparison with related language Yuxi Municipality is located in the middle of Yunnan Province, with a distance of 88 kilometers from Kunming city, the provincial capital. Yuxi Municipality, with a total area of 15,285 km², consists of one district and eight counties under its jurisdiction, namely, Hongta District, Tonghai County, Jiangchuan County, Chengjiang County, Huaning County, Yimen County, Eshan Yi Autonomous County, Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County and Yuanjiang Hani, Yi and Dai Autonomous County. There are 25 nationalities with a total population of 2.276 million in Yuxi Municipality. They are Chinese, Yi, Hani, Dai, Hui, Bai, Mongolia, Miao, Lahu nationality groups, etc. Over 33 percent of the total population in the Yuxi Municipality territory is the minority nationalities.

The three hamlets are located in east longitude 102°17′32″ and north latitude 24°08′30″, in the mountains between 1700 and 1900 meters height above sea-level.

There are about 600 people living in Sorbung village. However, my consultants tell me that a very similar language variety is spoken in several of the surrounding villages and that the area shows less linguistic diversity than most of the Tangkhul area. Sorbung has some very Kuki-Chin like characteristics, extending beyond the numeral system.

The first set of numerals are used to count for non-human objects and the numerals with an asterisk mark are used to count human. The etymologies of four, seven, and eight are fairly clear. The numeral four (píniipt) is analyzed by Jacobs (1931) and Rigsby (1965) as two (niipt) plus a prefix pa- meaning one to another or a pair. Vowel assimilation changes pa- to pi-. So, píniipt is ‘two by two’ or ‘two twos’. túskaas, the number seven, is related to the instrumental prefix tux̱s- ‘with pointed end’, and refers to the seventh or index finger. Rigsby proposes that the suffix -aas could be a fossilized allomorph the first person clitic, giving ‘my pointer’(1965: 117). It also could be the nominalizer -as that is used with things done by or used by a person. In that case, seven means ‘a thing people use for pointing.’ (The current name for he pointer finger is tuskáwas.) pax̱at’umáat ‘eight’ is a combination of páx̱aat ‘five’ and mɨtáat ‘three’. In 1994 the Yakama Nation began using the spelling Yakama. Virginia Beavert prefers the spelling Yakima because the elders working with Rigsby on the 1975 Yakima Language Practical Dictionary chose iiyaakíima as the best representation of the name of the language and tribe. See the attached for a phonetic chart. It is in the Yakima Practical alphabet. The differences between the Yakima Practical alphabet and the above are: (1) the Yakima practical alphabet uses an underscored k (ḵ) for uvular stop q, and an underscored x(x̱) for uvular fricative χ; (2) digraphs are used in the Yakima alphabet but not the alphabet: sh - š - ʃ, ch - č, ts – c, tɬ - ƛ, kw – kw , x̱w - χʷ Yakima phonology (using the Yakima practical alphabet ).

January 28, 2011.",,"Yanesha' has developed a decimal system, however the native counting system is not being used much any more. Spanish numeral system is much commonly used. The numbers 8 and 9 appear to be a borrowing from Quechua ""quanchis"" (as said in the Cuzco dialect). While the grammar of Yanesha’ is typically Arawakan, the Yanesha’ lexicon shows an very remarkable import from the ancient Yaru dialect of Quechua I, spoken in the eastern Andes during the time of the Inca Empire before the Spanish conquest (Willem Adelaar 2006: 290). The Yanesha’ language is therefore a unique example of past contact between Andean and Amazonian peoples before colonization. I do not have any Yaru data on hand, but presumably its numerals would have been quite similar to the Cuzco dialect. Yaru is an extinct dialect of Quechua, once spoken near Yanesha territory. See attached figure of Quechua linguistic family, taken from the internet. Yaru is high-lighted in green. Anthropologist Richard Chase Smith also attests that Yanesha has substantial influence from Yunga (works not published yet). I need to look into that. Number 9. Please note that this numeral varies between [eskont] and [eskon]. It appears to be borrowed from Quechua ""esqon"" and the Yanesha may have added the final [t], unless the ancient Yaru speakers had the final [t] and it was borrowed that way, then simplified. Number 19. The last word can vary from [eskont] to [eskon] depending on the speaker. The information you provided on the form corresponds to the Yanesha orthography that was used between 1955-2009, invented by the SIL. When I first did fieldwork and wrote my thesis, they were still using this system, but it had many challenges: the SIL system did not account for some of the phonetic subleties of the language, and very importantly, Yanesha teachers had trouble getting those symbols on computers and using them in email. As of 2010, partly because of my own encouragement and the frustration of the bilingual teachers to produce teaching new materials on modern computers that are scattered throughout their region of the Amazon, they lobbied the Yanesha Federation to help them approve a new orthography. They also had a lot of help from Mary Ruth Wise, an SIL linguist who has worked with them since the 1950s, and has helped them tailor the changes. I was helping the Yanesha people work on this topic between January and June 2010 and last I had heard, near the end of December, they were still in the process of approving the new alphabet, and arguing over certain symbols, so I think it is not fully decided upon yet. Please keep the old orthography for the time being and don't change it to the new one yet. Let me get in touch with one of my main informants to see if it has been finally approved before I send you the exact run-down of the numerals in the new orthography. just to give you an idea of the proposed changes, here are numbers 1-10 in the new orthography, very similar to the old one, but with a few important changes. 1. patherr (palatalized consonants now are written with 'h' instead of tilde. This is to mimic Brazilian Portuguese). 2. epa 3. ma'pa 4. pa'tats 5. amnar 6. pechap 7. canc'herr ([ch] with umlaut over top of it has been replaced by [c'h] 8. posok (c replaced by k) 9. eskont / eskon 10. c'harra' ([ch] with umlaut over top of it has been replaced by [c'h] Note on Yanesha Consonants & Orthographyː B = IPA [β]; b̃ = IPA[βʲ]; c = IPA [k]; qu(ë) = IPA[ke]; c̈= IPA [kʲ]; ch = IPA [tʃ]; c̈h = IPA [tʂ]; g = IPA [ɣ], guë = IPA [ɣʲ], h(u)= IPA [w]; j = IPA [x] or [xʲ]; ll = IPA [lʲ]; m̃ = IPA [mʲ]; n̈ = IPA [nʲ]; p̈ = IPA [pʲ]; r = IPA [ɾ]; rɹ IPA [ʐ]; sh = IPA [ʃ]; t̃= IPA [tʃʲ]; y = IPA[j].

The word ''wanoho'' simple means many and often they will tap their fingers or hands together to give an idea of how many. Thus one tap or clap would be 10, two 20, three 30, four 40, five 50 etc. Or they would say, ""all the fingers and all the toes of five people"" for 100 ""All the fingers and all the toes of ten men"" for 200 thus all the fingers and all the toes of 50 men for 1000.

The word for ‘five’ (aŋɡai̯) is transparently derived from aŋɡa ‘piece, side’ plus i ‘hand, arm’ (optionally, the word kwe ‘one’ may be added to this, i.e., aŋɡai̯ kwe). This reflects the system of hand-counting that underlies the quinary numerical system—that is, people start to count objects using the fingers of one hand. When all fingers have been extended (that is, when the number ‘five’ has been reached), they have created a single outstretched palm (that is, one ‘side’ of ‘hand’). The numbers six through nine contain verbal elements, which, when taken literally, express that ‘numbers’ (probably in origin palm fronds or other counters) have been ‘cut’ (won) and ‘put atop’ (wat-lɨ-p) the number five (mo= is a 3sg object marker, min= is a 3du object marker, and ndɨ= is a 3pl object marker). The number ten is of the form ‘five (times) two’. An alternate form, nali ‘ten’, reflects the traditional system for counting larger numbers in Ulwa, as this word also refers to the spines of sago fronds, which were used to mark units of ten when counting larger sums. The number twenty can be expressed either as ‘five (times) four’ or ‘ten (times) two’. It can also be denoted by the phrase lamndu unduwan ‘pig(’s) head’, a term reflecting modern Papua New Guinean currency, as the twenty-kina note has the picture of a pig’s head. (Higher-number counting was probably not a common practice among Ulwa speakers before the introduction of a cash economy.) Similarly, the number fifty can be expressed either as ‘ten (times) five’ or as ankam unduwan ‘person(’s) head’, this phrase likewise reflecting the fact that the fifty-kina note contains the image of a man’s head (that of Prime Minister Michael Somare). Finally, the number one hundred is expressed as uta (kwe) ‘(one) bird’, similarly derived from the fact that the hundred-kina note contains the image of a bird (a bird-of-paradise, the nation’s symbol). Ulwa, identified as “Yaul” in Ethnologue (21st ed.), is spoken in Angoram District, East Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea."

In Maklew the word is /bl/, which makes five ‘one hand’. it seems to be used for ‘ten’ too, but I don’t know what the other part in the word and they spelled /bl/ as part of the word in both cases. To make it even more confusing, at some point they gave me /blinage-blmepola/ as the equivalent of ‘three’ and I think I have seen the prefix in other cases to mean ‘one further’. Moreover, when I ask for an example sentence for ‘ten’, he spontaneously gave me a sentence, which translates as ‘I have five male dogs and five female dogs’ meaning he has ten dogs, so I am not sure if this ‘ten’ is really used for counting."

When three (mur) is said, the middle finger is folded down, when four (eis) is said the index finger is folded down, when five (letrane) is said a fist is made with the left hand. (Left handed people probably use the other hand). When six (letrane wuri kera) is said (‘five holding one’), the little finger on the right hand is folded down. This is repeated with each finger and then a fist is made with the right and and the two fists are brought together in front of the body and the word ten (letpeis) is said (‘hand-two’). The system is a digit-tally one. There are four basic numerals.

The Yora (Nahua) speakers I have worked with in Sepahua, Ucayali, Peru report the same numeral system as for what I've termed the Purus dialect of Yaminawa. However, these Nahua speakers are all women married to Yaminawa men, and have been living among Yaminawa for many years. The languages are highly similar phonologically and morphosyntactically, but older, monolingual Nahua may use forms which vary from Yaminawa phonologically. Currently, all evidence points to the Nahua using a numeral system which is identical to Yaminawa. The only notable difference is that the Nahua use the term [bibi] for 'hand' or 'five' instead of [mɨ̃kɨ̃] which is most commonly used among the Yaminawa."

NTM (New Tribes Mission) (1991) Dictionario yuracaré-castellano, castellano-yuracaré.",,"In Yurakare counting system, only 1-4 are the indigenous numbers remain/are known to us, after four, they used the Spanish numbers. In counting, a suffix -tti is added to the Spanish numeral. We call it -NUM for ‘numeral’. It is not really clear up to which number the numerals are loan words and where the use of numerals can rather be considered a code-switch to Spanish. I have heard them use the number at least up to 15 with the suffix -tti, after that I am not sure. So I included the numbers only up to there. Higher numbers could be considered code-switches, although I am not really sure about that. The letter <ë> represents a low front vowel [æ]. The grapheme <ch> represents the affricate [tʃ]."

The above chart represents the traditional counting system. In actual practice, the younger generation is now using the Spanish terms for numbers above five. In the traditional system any number above 20 would be counted as many. The inanimate form for many is: ˈpʰáḁhɛ́ɛ̥. The animate form for many isː ˈpʰáḁhɨ́ɨ̥. The word pʰɛ̃̄nĩ̄i̥ˈpɛ́alõ at the end of the compound forms beginning with number six means ‘passing from one to another’ which indicates that if the person was counting on one hand, then he continues counting on the other hand. Likewise, when counting beyond ten, counting moves from two hands to a foot, then from two hands and a foot to another foot. The animate classifiers are: -ɨ/-ɨ̃ or -ɡɨ / -ɡɨ̃ ‘m.sg.’ - o/-o) or -ɡo/-ɡo) ‘f.sg.’ -a/-a) or -ɾa /-ɾa) ‘pl’ Examples: ĩ̀i̥'kʰɨ́ ‘one male’ ĩ̀i̥'kʰṍ 'one female' ĩ̀i̥'kʰã́ɾã̄ 'some peopel' It is easy to observe the way these change according to whether their environment is oral or nasal.

Voiceless vocoids occur before voiceless stops, the voiceless fricative [s] and the voiceless glottal [h]. 2. Aspiration on voiceless stops is in free variation with unaspirated voiceless stops. 3. Prenasalization occurs on voiced stops word initial and following a nasalized vocoid. 4. High tone always occurs on the stressed syllable. Syllables prior to the stressed syllable have low tone. Tone tends to go down following high tone, but high tone can be maintained through two or more syllables or throughout the rest of the word."
